# Data Vis with AlgebraOfGraphics.jl  {#sec:datavizAoG}

[AlgebraOfGraphics.jl](http://juliaplots.org/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl/stable/) (AoG) defines a language for data visualization. It is based on a few simple building blocks that can be combined using `+` and `*`.

```
using AlgebraOfGraphics, CairoMakie
```

```jl
@sco JDS.first_plot_with_AoG()
```

It seems to work fine.
