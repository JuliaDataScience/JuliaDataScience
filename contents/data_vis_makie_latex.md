## Using LaTeXStrings.jl

LaTeX support in `Makie.jl` is also available via `LaTeXStrings.jl`:

```
using LaTeXStrings
```

Simple use cases are shown below (@fig:latex_strings).
A basic example includes LaTeX strings for x-y labels and legends:

```jl
@sc LaTeX_Strings()
```

```jl
s = """
    CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
    with_theme(LaTeX_Strings, publication_theme())
    label = "latex_strings" # hide
    caption = "Plot with LaTeX strings." # hide
    link_attributes = "width=60%" # hide
    Options(current_figure(); filename=label, caption, label, link_attributes) # hide
    """
sco(s)
```

A more involved example will be one with some equation as `text` and increasing legend numbering for curves in a plot:

```jl
@sco JDS.multiple_lines()
```

But, some lines have repeated colors, so thats no good.
Adding some markers and line styles usually helps.
So, let's do that using [`Cycles`](http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/theming.html#Cycles) for these types.
Setting `covary=true` allows to cycle all elements together:

```jl
@sco JDS.multiple_scatters_and_lines()
```

And voil√†.
A publication quality plot is here.
What more can we ask for?
Well, what about different default colors or palettes.
In our next section, we will see how to use again [`Cycles`](http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/theming.html#Cycles) and know a little bit more about them, plus some additional keywords in order to achieve this.
