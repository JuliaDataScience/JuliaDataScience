## Themes {#sec:themes}

There are several ways to affect the general appearance of your plots.
Either, you could use a [predefined theme](https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/theming/predefined_themes/) or your own custom theme.
For example, use the predefined dark theme via `with_theme(your_plot_function, theme_dark())`.
Or, build your own with `Theme(kwargs)` or even update the one that is active with `update_theme!(kwargs)`.

You can also do `set_theme!(theme; kwargs...)` to change the current default theme to `theme` and override or add attributes given by `kwargs`.
If you do this and want to reset all previous settings just do `set_theme!()` with no arguments.
See the following examples, where we had prepared a `demo_figure` with different characteristics, such that most attributes for each theme can be appreciated.

Our `demo_figure` plotting function looks like follows:

```jl
@sc JDS.demo_figure()
```

Where we had use several keyword arguments for `Axis`, `Legend` and `Colorbar`,
please play with them and see how they work.

Currently, there are five themes:

> - `theme_dark()`
> - `theme_black()`
> - `theme_ggplot2()`
> - `theme_minimal()`
> - `theme_light()`

```jl
JDS.themes_gallery()
```

Another alternative is defining a custom `Theme` by doing `with_theme(your_plot, your_theme())`.
For instance, the following theme could be a simple version for a publication quality template:

```jl
@sc publication_theme()
```

Which, for simplicity we use it to plot `scatterlines` and a `heatmap`.

```jl
@sc plot_with_legend_and_colorbar()
```

Then, using the previously defined `Theme` the output is shown in Figure (@fig:plot_with_legend_and_colorbar).

```jl
s = """
    CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
    with_theme(plot_with_legend_and_colorbar, publication_theme())
    label = "plot_with_legend_and_colorbar" # hide
    caption = "Themed plot with Legend and Colorbar." # hide
    link_attributes = "width=60%" # hide
    Options(current_figure(); filename=label, label, caption, link_attributes) # hide
    """
sco(s)
```

Here we have use `with_theme` which is more convenient for the direct application of a theme than the `do` syntax. You should use the latter if you want to include extra arguments to the theme that is going to be applied.

Now, if something needs to be changed after `set_theme!(your_theme)`, we can do it with `update_theme!(resolution=(500, 400), fontsize=18)`, for example.
Another approach will be to pass additional arguments to the `with_theme` function:

```jl
s = """
    CairoMakie.activate!() # hide
    fig = (resolution=(600, 400), figure_padding=1, backgroundcolor=:grey90)
    ax = (; aspect=DataAspect(), xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y")
    cbar = (; height=Relative(4 / 5))
    with_theme(publication_theme(); fig..., Axis=ax, Colorbar=cbar) do
        plot_with_legend_and_colorbar()
    end
    label = "plot_theme_extra_args" # hide
    caption = "Theme with extra args." # hide
    link_attributes = "width=60%" # hide
    Options(current_figure(); filename=label, caption, label, link_attributes) # hide
    """
sco(s)
```

Where the $x$ and $y$ labels have a Latex format due to `L"..."`.
Most basic Latex strings are already supported by Makie, however to fully exploit this integration is recommend to also load the package LaTeXStrings as stated in the next section.
