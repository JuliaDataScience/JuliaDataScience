## Join {#sec:join}

At the start of this chapter, we showed multiple tables and gave questions related to multiple tables.
However, we haven't talked about combining tables yet, which we will do in this section.
In `DataFrames.jl`, combining multiple tables is done via _joins_.
Joins are extremely powerful, but might take some time to wrap your head around.
It is not necessary to know the joins below by heart, the [`DataFrames.jl` documentation](https://DataFrames.juliadata.org/stable/man/joins/) and this book list them too.
But, it's good to know that they exists.
If you ever find yourself looping over rows in a DataFrame and comparing it with other data, then you probably need one of the joins below.

In @sec:dataframes, we've introduced the grades for 2020:

```jl
s = "grades_2020()"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

Now, we're going to combine that with the information from 2021:

```jl
s = "grades_2021()"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

To do this, we are going to use joins.
The `DataFrames.jl` lists no less than seven kinds of joins.
We show them all here, because they are all useful.
This first mentioned one is `innerjoin`.
Suppose that we have two datasets `A` and `B` with respectively columns `A_1, A_2, ..., A_n` and `B_1, B_2, ..., B_m` **and** one of the columns has the same name, say `A_1` and `B_1` are both called `:id`.
Then, the inner join on `:id` will go through all the elements in `A_1` and compare it to the elements in `B_1`.
If the elements are **the same**, then it will add all the information from `A_2, ..., A_n` and `B_2, ..., B_m` behind it.

Okay, so no worries if you didn't get this description.
The result on the grades datasets looks like this:

```jl
s = "innerjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

Note that only "Sally" and "Hank" are in both datasets.
The name _inner_ join makes sense since, in mathematics, the _set intersection_ is defined by "all elements in $A$, that are also in $B$, or all elements in $B$ that are also in $A$".

Maybe, you're now thinking "aha, if we have an _inner_, then we probably also have an _outer_".
Yes, you've guessed right!
The `outerjoin` is much less strict than the `innerjoin` and just takes any row it can find which contains a name:

```jl
s = "outerjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

So, this method can create missing data even though non of the original datasets had missing values.
We can get even more missing data if we use the `crossjoin`.
This gives the Cartesian product of the rows, which is basically multiplication of rows, that is, for every row create a combination with any other row:

```jl
s = "crossjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:id)"
sce(s; post=trim_last_n_lines(2))
```

Oops.
Since the crossjoin doesn't take the elements in the row into account, we don't need to specify `on` what we want to join:

```jl
s = "crossjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021())"
sce(s; post=trim_last_n_lines(6))
```

Oops again.
This is a very common error with DataFrames and joins.
The tables for the 2020 and 2021 grades have a duplicate column name, namely `:name`.
We can just pass `makeunique=true` to solve this:

```jl
s = "crossjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); makeunique=true)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

So, now, we have one row for each grade from everyone in grades 2020 and grades 2021 datasets.
For direct queries, such as "who has the highest grade?", the Cartesian product is usually not so useful, but for (statistical) queries, it can be.

More useful for scientific projects are the `leftjoin` and `rightjoin`.
The left join gives all the elements in the _left_ DataFrame:

```jl
s = "leftjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

Here, grades for "Bob" and "Alice" were missing in the grades 2021 table, so that's why there are missing elements.
The right join does sort of the opposite:

```jl
s = "rightjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

Now, grades in 2020 are missing.
Note that `leftjoin(A, B) != rightjoin(B, A)`, because the order of the columns will differ.
For example, compare the output below to the previous output:

```jl
s = "leftjoin(grades_2021(), grades_2020(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

Lastly, we have the `semijoin` and `antijoin`.
The semi join is even more restrictive than the inner join.
It returns only the elements from the left DataFrame which are in both DataFrames.
This is like a combination of the left join with the inner join.

```jl
s = "semijoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

The opposite of the semi join is the anti join.
It returns only the elements from the left DataFrame which are **not** in the right DataFrame:

```jl
s = "antijoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)"
sco(s; process=without_caption_label)
```

## Variable Transformations

```{=comment}
manipulate variables
DataFrames.transform
Ifelse and case_when
```

In @sec:filter, we saw that `filter` works by taking one or more source columns and filtering it by applying a function.
In other words, we saw that `source => f::Function` like in, for example, `filter(:name => name -> name == "Alice", df)`.
In @sec:select, we saw that `select` can take one or more source columns and put it into one or more target columns `source => target` like in, for example, `select(df, :name => :people_names)`.
In this section, we discuss how to **transform** variables.
This goes via `source => transformation => target`.
