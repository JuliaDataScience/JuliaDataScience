# Julia 101 {#sec:julia_101}

We should include a nice warning box here saying:

In this chapter we will cover the basic of Julia as a programming language.
Please note that this is not *strictly necessary* for you to use Julia as a tool of data manipulation and data visualization.
Having a basic understanding of Julia will definitely make you more *effective* and *efficient* in using Julia.
You can skip to the @sec:dataframes_overview (we could reference a part?) without any significant disadvantages (we better word than disadvantages).
