## Load and Save Files {#sec:load_save}

Having only data inside Julia programs and not being able to load or save it would be very limiting.
Therefore, we start by mentioning how to store files to disk and how to load files from disk.
We focus on CSV, see @sec:csv, and Excel, see @sec:excel, since those are the most common data storage formats.

### CSV {#sec:csv}

Comma-separated value (CSV) files are are very effective way to store tables.
CSV files have two advantages over other data storage files.
Firstly, it does exactly what the name indicates it does, namely storing values by separating them using commas.
This acronym is also used as the file extension.
So, be sure that you save your files using the ".csv" extension such as "myfile.csv".
To demonstrate how a CSV file looks, we can install the `CSV.jl` package:

```
julia> ]

pkg> add CSV
```

and load it via

```
using CSV
```

We can now use our previous data:

```jl
sco("
grades_2020()
"; process=without_caption_label)
```

and read it from a file after writing it

```jl
@sc write_grades_csv()
```

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_csv()
read(path, String)
end # hide
""")
```

Here, we also see the second benefit of this data format:
the data can be read by using a text editor.
This is unlike many alternatives which require proprietary software.

This is all very nice, of course, but what if our data **contains commas** as values?
If we would naively write data with commas, it would make the files very hard to convert back to a table.
Luckily, CSV solves it for us automatically.
Consider the following data with commas:

```jl
@sco grades_with_commas()
```

If we write this, we get

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
function write_comma_csv()
    path = "grades-commas.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_with_commas())
end
path = write_comma_csv()
read(path, String)
end # hide
""")
```

So, CSV adds quotation marks `"` around the comma containing values.
Another common way to solve this problem, is to write the data to a tab-separated value (TSV) file.
This assumes that the data doesn't contain tabs, which holds in most cases.

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
function write_comma_tsv()
    path = "grades-comma.tsv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_with_commas(); delim='\\t')
end
read(write_comma_tsv(), String)
end # hide
""")
```

You can also come up with other delimiters, such as semicolons ";", spaces "\ ", or even something as unusual as "Ï€".

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
function write_space_separated()
    path = "grades-space-separated.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_2020(); delim=' ')
end
read(write_space_separated(), String)
end # hide
""")
```

By convention, its still best to give files with special delimiters, such as ";", the `.csv` extension.

Loading data in a similar way.
Now, use `CSV.read` and specify in what kind of format you want the output.
We specify a DataFrame.

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_csv()
CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
end # hide
"""; process=without_caption_label)
```

Conveniently, CSV will automatically infer column types:

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_csv()
df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
end # hide
"""; process=string, post=output_block)
```

It works even for more complex data:

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
my_data = \"\"\"
    a,b,c,d,e
    Kim,2018-02-03,3,4.0,2018-02-03T10:00
    \"\"\"
path = "my_data.csv"
write(path, my_data)
df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
end # hide
"""; process=string, post=output_block)
```

These CSV basics should cover most use-cases.

### Excel {#sec:excel}

There are multiple Julia packages to read Excel files.
In this book, we will only look at [`XLSX.jl`](https://github.com/felipenoris/XLSX.jl), because it is the most actively maintained package in the Julia's ecosystem that deals with Excel data.
As a second benefit, `XLSX.jl` is written in pure Julia, which makes it easy for us to inspect the implementation and to use it.

Install the package via

```
julia> ]

pkg> add XLSX
```

and load it via

```jl
sc("""
import XLSX
""")
```

To write files, we define a little helper function

```jl
@sc write_xlsx("", DataFrame())
```

Now, we can easily write the grades to an Excel file

```jl
@sc write_grades_xlsx()
```

When reading it back, we will see that `XLSX.jl` puts the data in a sheet:

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_xlsx()
xf = XLSX.readxlsx(path)
end # hide
""")
```

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
xf = XLSX.readxlsx(write_grades_xlsx())
sheet = xf["Sheet1"]
XLSX.eachtablerow(sheet) |> DataFrame
end # hide
"""; process=without_caption_label)
```
