## Load and Save Files {#sec:load_save}

Having only data inside Julia programs and not being able to load or save it would be very limiting.
Therefore, we start by mentioning how to store files to disk and how to load files from disk.
We focus on CSV, see @sec:csv, and Excel, see @sec:excel, since those are the most common.

### CSV {#sec:csv}

Comma-separated value (CSV) files are are ridiculously effective way to store tables.
Unlike many competing data storage solutions, CSV files have two advantages.
Firstly, it does exactly what the name indicates it does, namely storing values by separating the columns by commas.
This abbreviation is, also, used as the file extension.
So, be sure that you save your files as "myfile.csv".
To demonstrate how a CSV file looks, we can install the CSV package:

```
julia> ]

pkg> add CSV
```

and load it via

```
using CSV
```

We can, now, take some data:

```jl
sco("
grades_2020()
"; process=without_caption_label)
```

and read it from a file after writing it

```jl
@sc write_grades_csv()
```

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_csv()
read(path, String)
end # hide
""")
```

Here, we also see the second benefit of this data format:
the data can be read by using a text editor.
This is unlike many alternatives which require proprietary software.

This is all very nice, of course, but what if our data **contains commas**?
If we would naively write data with commas, it would make the files very hard to convert back to a table.
Luckily, CSV solves it for us automatically.
Consider the following data with commas:

```jl
@sco grades_with_commas()
```

If we write this, we get

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
function write_comma_csv()
    path = "grades-commas.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_with_commas())
end
path = write_comma_csv()
read(path, String)
end # hide
""")
```

So, CSV adds quotation marks around the comma containing values.
Another common way to solve this problem, is to write the data to a tab-separated value (TSV) file.
This assumes that the data doesn't contain tabs, which holds in most cases.

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
function write_comma_tsv()
    path = "grades-comma.tsv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_with_commas(); delim='\\t')
end
read(write_comma_tsv(), String)
end # hide
""")
```

You can also come up with other delimiters, such as semicolons ";", spaces "\ ", or even something as unusual as "Ï€".

```jl
sco("""
JDS.output_block_inside_tempdir() do # hide
function write_space_separated()
    path = "grades-space-separated.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_2020(); delim=' ')
end
read(write_space_separated(), String)
end # hide
""")
```

By convention, its still best to give files with special delimiters, such as ";", the `.csv` extension.

Loading data in a similar way.
Now, use `CSV.read` and specify in what kind of format you want the output.
We specify a DataFrame.

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_csv()
CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
end # hide
"""; process=without_caption_label)
```

Conveniently, CSV will automatically infer types:

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_csv()
df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
end # hide
"""; process=string, post=output_block)
```

even for more complex data:

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
my_data = \"\"\"
    a,b,c,d,e
    Kim,2018-02-03,3,4.0,2018-02-03T10:00
    \"\"\"
path = "my_data.csv"
write(path, my_data)
df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
end # hide
"""; process=string, post=output_block)
```

These CSV basics should cover most use-cases.

### Excel {#sec:excel}

There are multiple Julia packages to read Excel files.
In this book, we will only look at [XLSX.jl](https://github.com/felipenoris/XLSX.jl), because we have the best experiences with it.
XLSX.jl is written in pure Julia, which makes it easy for us to inspect the implementation and to use it.

Install the package via

```
julia> ]

pkg> add XLSX
```

and load it via

```jl
sc("""
import XLSX
""")
```

To write files, we define a little helper function

```jl
@sc write_xlsx("", DataFrame())
```

Now, we can easily write the grades to an Excel file

```jl
@sc write_grades_xlsx()
```

When reading it back, we will see that XLSX puts the data in a sheet:

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
path = write_grades_xlsx()
xf = XLSX.readxlsx(path)
end # hide
""")
```

```jl
sco("""
JDS.inside_tempdir() do # hide
xf = XLSX.readxlsx(write_grades_xlsx())
sheet = xf["Sheet1"]
XLSX.eachtablerow(sheet) |> DataFrame
end # hide
"""; process=without_caption_label)
```
