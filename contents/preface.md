# Preface {#sec:preface}

In this book, we discuss two important aspects of data analysis.
Actually, there is a third one, Julia, but it deserves a whole chapter (see @sec:why_julia).

First, we emphasize the **"data" part of data science** and why data skills are, and will remain, in **high demand** in industry as well as in academia.

Second, we make an argument for **incorporate software engineering practices into data science** which should reduce friction in updating and sharing code with collaborators.
Most data analyses are a collaborative endeavor; that is why these practices will help you.

### Data is Everywhere {#sec:data_everywhere}

**Data is abundant** and will be even more in the near future.
A report from late 2012 concluded that from 2005 to 2020, the amount of data stored digitally will **grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes^[1 exabyte (EB) = 1,000,000 terabyte (TB).] to a whooping 40,000 exabytes** [@gantz2012digital].
This is equal to 40 trillion gigabytes and, to put it into perspective, more than **5.2 terabytes for every living human currently in this planet!**
In 2020, on average, every person created **1.7 MB of data per second** [@domo2018data].
A recent report predicted that almost **two thirds (65%) of national GDPs will have undergone digitization by 2022** [@fitzgerald2020idc].

Every profession will be impacted by the increasing availability of data and data's increased importance [@chen2014big; @khan2014big].
Data is used to communicate and build knowledge, and to make decisions.
This is why data skills are important.
If you become comfortable with handling data, you will become a valuable researcher or professional.
In other words, you will become **data literate**.

## What is Data Science? {#sec:why_data_science}

Data science is not only machine learning and statistics, also, it is not all about prediction.
Alas, it is not even a discipline fully contained within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields [@Meng2019Data].
But, one thing that we can assure with high confidence is that data science is always about **data**.
Our aims of this book are twofold:

* We focus on the backbone of data science: data.
* We use to Julia programming language to process the data.

We cover why Julia is an extremely effective language for data science in @sec:why_julia.
For now, let's turn our attention towards data.

### Data Literacy {#sec:data_literacy}

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_literacy), the formal definition of **data literacy is "the ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data as information."**.
We also like the informal idea that, as a data literate, you won't feel overwhelmed by data, but instead can use it to make the right decisions.
Data literacy can be seen as a highly competitive skill to possess.
In this book we'll cover two aspects of data literacy:

1. **Data Manipulation** with `DataFrames.jl` (@sec:dataframes).
In this chapter you will learn how to:
    1. Read CSV and Excel data into Julia.
    2. Process data in Julia, that is, learn how to answer data questions.
1. **Data Visualization** with `Plots.jl` and `Makie.jl` (@sec:datavisPlots and @sec:datavisMakie).
In these chapter you will learn how to:
    1. ...
    2. ...
    3. ...

## Software engineering and data science {#sec:engineering}

Unlike most books on data science, this book lays more emphasis on properly **structuring code**.
The reason for this is that we noticed that many data scientists simply place their code into one large file and run all the statements sequentially.
You can think of this as writing a book for someone and forcing that person to read it from beginning to end.
This works great for small and simple projects, but the bigger or more complex the project becomes, more problems will start to arise.
For example, with a well written book: the book is split into distinctly named chapters and sections which contains several references to other parts in the book.
The software equivalent of this is **splitting code into functions**.
Each function has a name and some contents.
With functions, you can basically tell the computer at any point in your code to jump to some other place and continue from there.
This allows you to more easily re-use code between projects, update code, share code, collaborate and see the big picture.
Hence, with functions, you can **save time**.

So, while reading this book you will eventually get accustomed to reading and using functions.
Also, another benefit of having good software engineering skills is that it will allow you to more easily read the packages's source code that you're using, which could be greatly beneficial when you are debugging your code or wonder how exactly the code works.
Finally, you can rest assured that we did not at all invented ourselves this emphasis on functions.
In industry, it is common practice to encourage developers to use **"functions instead of comments"**.
That means that, instead of writing a comment for humans and some code for the computer, the developers write a function which is universally read by humans and computers.

Also, we've put much effort into sticking to a consistent style guide.
Programming style guides provide guidelines for writing code.
For example, about where there should be whitespace and what names should be capitalized, or not.
Sticking to a strict style guide might sound pedantic and it sometimes is.
However, the more consistent the code is, the easier it is to read and understand the code.
To read our code, you don't need to know our style guide.
You'll figure it out when reading.
If you do want to see the details of our style guide, checkout @sec:notation.
