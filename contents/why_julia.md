# Why Julia? {#sec:why_julia}

The world of data science is already filled with different open source programming languages.

Industry has mostly adopted Python and academia have adopted R.
**Why bother learning another language?**
To answer this question, we will address two common backgrounds:

1. **Did not program before** -- see @sec:non-programmers.

2. **Did program before** -- see @sec:programmers.

## For non-programmers {#sec:non-programmers}

In the first background, the common underlying story is the following.

Data science has captivated you, making you interested in learning what is it all about and how can you use it to build your career in academia or industry.
Then, you try to find resources to learn this new craft and you stumble into a world of intricate acronyms: `pandas`, `dplyr`, `data.table`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ggplot2`, `bokeh`, and the list goes on and on...

Out of the blue you hear a name: "Julia".
What is this?
How is it any different from other stuff that I've been told that I need to do data science?

Why should I dedicate my precious time into learning a language that is almost never mentioned in any job listing, lab position, postdoc offer or academic job description?.
The answer is that **Julia is a fresh approach** both to programming and data science.
Everything that you do in Python or in R you can do it in Julia with the advantage of using readable[^readable], fast, and powerful code syntax.
Therfore, we see that the Julia language is gaining traction, and for good reasons.

So, **if you don't have any programming background knowledge, we highly encourage you to take up Julia** as a first programming language and data science framework.

## For programmers {#sec:programmers}

In the second background, the common underlying story changes a little bit.
You are someone who knows how to program and probably does this for a living.
You are well-versed (or even fluent) in Python or R.
You've heard about this new flashy thing called "data science" and you wanna jump on the bandwagon.
You begin to learn how to do stuff in `numpy`, how to manipulate `DataFrames` in `pandas` and how to plot things in `matplotlib`.
Or maybe you've learned all that in R by using the tidyverse and `tibbles`, `data.frames`, `%>%` (pipes) and `geom_*`...

Then, from someone or somewhere you become aware about this new language called "Julia".
Why bother?
You are already proficient in Python or R and you can do everything that you need.
Well, let us contemplate some plausible scenarios.

**Have you ever in Python or R:**

1. Done something and had to wait minutes for it to finish?
Well, **in Julia Python or R minutes can be translated to seconds**^[and sometimes milliseconds.].
We reserved @sec:julia_wild for displaying successful Julia use cases in both academia and industry.


2. Tried to do something different than `numpy`/`dplyr` conventions and discovered that your code is slow and you'll probably have to learn dark magic^[`numba`, or even `Rcpp` or `cython`?] to make it faster?
**In Julia you can do your custom different stuff without loss of performance**.

3. Had to debug code and somehow you see yourself reading a Fortran or C/C++ source code and having no idea what you are trying to accomplish?
**In Julia you only read Julia code[^readable], no need to learn another language to make your original language fast**.
This is called the "two-language problem" (see @sec:two_language).
It also covers the use case for when "you had an interesting idea and wanted to contribute to an open-source package and gave up because almost everything is not in Python or R but in C/C++ or Fortran"^[have a look at some deep learning libraries in GitHub and you'll be surprised that Python is only 25%-33% of the codebase.].

4. Wanted to use a data structure defined in a package in another package and found that doesn't work and you'll probably need to build an interface^[this is most a Python ecosystem problem, while R doesn't suffer heavily from this is not blue skies either.].
**Julia allows users to easily share and reuse code from different packages.**
Most of Julia user-defined types and functions work right out of the bat^[or with little effort necessary.] and some users are even marvelled upon discovering how their packages are being used by other libraries in ways that they could not have imagined.
We have some examples in @sec:multiple_dispatch.

5. Needed to have a better project management, with dependecies and version control tightly controlled, manageable and replicable?
**Julia has an amazing project management solution allied to a great package manager**.
Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single global set of packages.
Julia package manager is designed around “environments”: independent sets of packages that can be local to an individual project or shared.
Each project maintains its own independent set of package versions.
We'll talk more about how to manage your projects and packages in the Appendix [-@sec:project_management].

If we got your attention by exposing somewhat familiar or plausible situations, you might be interested to learn more about this newcomer called Julia.

Let's proceed then!

## What Julia tries to accomplish? {#sec:julia_accomplish}

> **_NOTE:_**
> In this section we will explain the bells and whistles about what makes Julia shine as a programming language.
> If it becomes too technical for you, you can skip and go straight to @sec:dataframes to learn about tabular data with DataFrames.jl.

Julia [@bezanson2017julia] is a relatively new language, first released in 2012, aims to be **both easy and fast**.
It "runs like C^[sometimes even faster than C.] but reads like Python" [@perkelJuliaComeSyntax2019].
It was made for scientific computing, capable of handling **large amounts of data and computation** while still being fairly **easy to manipulate, create and protype code**.

The creators of julia explained why they created Julia in a [2012 blogpost](https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/).
Their motivations show how Julia was designed to be:

> We are greedy: we want more.
> We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license.
> We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby.
> We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab.
> We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell.
> Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy.
> We want it interactive and we want it compiled.

Most users are attracted to Julia because of the **superior speed**.
After all, Julia is a member of a prestigious and exclusive club.
The [**petaflop club**](https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/julia-joins-petaflop-club/) is comprised of languages who can exceed speeds of **one petaflop^[a petaflop is one thousand trillion, or one quadrillion, operations per second.] per second at peak performance**.
Currently only C, C++, Fortran and Julia belong to the [petaflop club](https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/11/28/julia-language-delivers-petascale-hpc-performance/).

But speed is not all that Julia can deliver.
The **ease of use**, **unicode support** and a language that makes **code sharing effortless** is some of Julia's features.
We'll address all those features in this section, but we want to focus on the Julia code sharing feature for now.

Julia ecosystem of packages is something unique.
It enables not only code sharing but also allows sharing of user-created types.
For example, Python's `pandas` uses its own `Datetime` type to handle dates.
The same with R tidyverse's `lubridate` package, which also defines its own `datetime` type to handle dates.
Julia doesn't need any of this, it has all the date stuff already baked onto its standard library.
This means that other packages don't have to worry about dates.
They just have to extend dates type to new functionalities by defining new functions and not having to touch a hair on creating new types.
Julia's `Dates` can do amazing stuff, but we are getting ahead of ourselves now.
Let's talk about the other Julia's features.

### Julia versus other programming languages

In [@fig:language_comparison] a highly opinionated representation it is shown, that divides the main open-source^[we have a very strong bias towards open-source and we won't discuss paid programming languages such as Matlab.] scientific computing languages in a 2x2 diagram with two axes: Slow-Fast and Easy-Hard.

We've put C++ and FORTRAN in the hard and fast quadrant.
Being static languages that needs compilation, type checking and other professional care and attention, they are really hard to learn and slow to prototype.
The advantage is that they are **really fast** languages.

R and Python goes into the easy and slow quadrant.
They are dynamic languages that are not compiled and executes in runtime.
Because of this they are really easy to learn and fast to prototype.
Of course, this come with a disadvantage: they are **really slow** languages.

Julia is the only language in the easy and fast quadrant.
We don't know any other serious language that would want to be hard and slow, so this quadrant is left empty.

![Scientific Computing Language Comparisons: logos for FORTRAN, C++, Python, R and Julia.](images/language_comparisons.png){#fig:language_comparison}

**Julia is fast!
Very fast!**
It was made for speed from the drawing board.
It accomplishes this by exposing native machine code to the compiler.
The compiler in turns does what it does best: optimizes machine code^[if you like to learn more about how Julia is designed you should definitely check @bezanson2017julia.].
You can find [benchmarks](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/) for Julia and several other languages here.
@fig:benchmarks was taken from [Julia's website benchmarks section^[please note that the Julia results depicted above do not include compile time.]](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/).
As you can see Julia is **indeed** fast.

![Julia versus other programming languages.](images/benchmarks.png){#fig:benchmarks}

We really believe in Julia.
(Otherwise, we wouldn't be writing this book.)
We think that Julia is the **future in scientific computing and scientific data analysis**.
It enables the user to develop rapid and powerful code with a simple syntax.
Usually, researchers develop code by prototyping using a very easy, but slow, language.
Once the code is assured to run correct and fulfill its goal, then begins the process of converting the code to a fast, but hard, language.
This is known as the "Two-Language Problem" and we discuss next.

### The Two-Language Problem {#sec:two_language}

The "Two-Language Problem" is a very typical situation in scientific computing where a researcher devises an algorithm or a solution to tackle a desired problem or analysis at hand.
Then, the solution is prototyped in an easy to code language (like Python or R).
If the prototype works the researcher  would code in a fast language that would not be easy to prototype (C++ or FORTRAN).
Thus, we have two languages involved in the process of developing a new solution.
One which is easy to prototype but is not suited for implementation (mostly due to being slow).
And another one which is not so easy to code (and consequently not easy to prototype) but suited for implementation (mostly because it is fast).
Julia comes to eliminate such situations by being the **same language that you prototype (ease of use) and implement the solution (speed)**.

Also, Julia lets you use **unicode characters as variables or parameters**.
This means no more using `sigma` or `sigma_i`, and instead just use $σ$ or $σᵢ$ as you would in mathematical notation.
When you see code for an algorithm or for a mathematical equation you see almost the same notation and idiom.
We call this feature **"One-To-One Code and Math Relation"**, while usually downplayed can be a powerful feature.

We think that the "Two-Language problem" and the "One-To-One Code and Math Relation" are best described by one of the creators of Julia, Alan Edelman, in a TEDx Talk [@tedxtalksProgrammingLanguageHeal2020] (if you are reading the printed book or a static PDF please click on the link to go the video or check the citation):

### Multiple Dispatch {#sec:multiple_dispatch}

To explain multiple dispatch, we'll give an illustrative example in **Python**.
Suppose that you want to have different types of researcher that will inherent from a "base" class `Researcher`.
The base class `Researcher` would define the initial common values for every derived class, namely `name` and `age`. These would go inside the default constructor method `__init__`:

```python
class Researcher:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

Now let us define a `Linguist` class that will inherent from the `Researcher` class.
We will also define a method `citation` that returns the citation style that is mostly used in the linguistics research field.

```python
class Linguist(Researcher):
    def citation(self):
        return "APA"
```

We do the same for the `ComputerScientist` class, but with different citation style:

```python
class ComputerScientist(Researcher):
   def citation(self):
       return "IEEE"
```

Finally, let's instantiate our two researchers, [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky) a linguist and [Judea Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl) a computer scientist with their respective ages:

```python
noam = Linguist("Noam Chomsky", 92)
judea = ComputerScientist("Judea Pearl", 84)
```

Now suppose you want to define a function that will have *different behaviors* depending on the *argument's types*.
For example, a linguist researcher might approach a computer scientist researcher and ask him to collaborate on a new paper.
The approach would be different if the situation were the opposite: a computer scientist researcher approaching the linguist researcher.
Below, you'll see that we defined two functions that should behave differently in both approaches:

```python
def approaches(li: Linguist, cs: ComputerScientist):
   print(f"Hey {cs.name}, wanna do a paper together? We need to use {li.citation()} style.")

def approaches(cs:ComputerScientist, li: Linguist):
    print(f"Hey {li.name}, wanna do a paper together? We need to use {cs.citation()} style.")
```

Now lets say Noam Chomsky approaches Judea Pearl with a paper idea:

```python
approaches(noam, judea)
```

```plaintext
Hey Judea Pearl, wanna do a paper? We need to use APA style.
```

That was not what `judea` as a `Linguist` type would say to `noam`, a `ComputerScientist` type.
This is **single dispatch** and is the default feature available on most object-oriented languages, like Python or C++.
Single dispatch just act on the first argument of a function.
Since both of our researchers `noam` and `judea` are instantiate as types inherited from the same base type `Researcher` we cannot implement what we are trying to do in Python.
You would need to change your approach with a substancial loss of simplicity (you would probably need to create different functions with different names).

**Now let's do this in Julia**.

In Julia, we don't have classes but we have structures (`struct`) that are meant to be "structured data": they define the kind of information that is embedded in the structure, that is a set of fields (i.e. "properties" or "attributes" in other languages), and then individual instances (or "objects") can be produced each with its own specific values for the fields defined by the structure.
They differ from the primitive types (e.g. integer and floats) that are by default defined already inside the core of the Julia language.
Thus, they are known as user-defined types.
The user can only create new `abstract type`s or `struct`s (which are also known as composite types).
In Julia, all `struct`s are final and may only have `abstract type`s as their supertypes.

First we'll create an `abstract type` named `Researcher`.

```jl
sc(
"""
abstract type Researcher end
"""
)
```

We proceed, similar as before, by creating two derived `struct`s from the `Researcher` abstract type.
Note that the `<:` operator is the subtype operator to assign that a `struct` or `type` is a subtype of another `struct` or `type`, which in turns would become a supertype (and we have the analogous `>:` operator).
We also create two field names, one for the researcher `name` and other for `age`.
They are represented as strings and 64-bit integers, respectively:

```jl
sc(
"""
struct Linguist <: Researcher
    name::AbstractString
    age::Int64
end
"""
)
```

```jl
sc(
"""
struct ComputerScientist <: Researcher
    name::AbstractString
    age::Int64
end
"""
)
```

The final step is to define two new functions that will behave differently depending on which derived `struct` of `Researcher` are the first or second argument.
We also use `$` for string interpolation of the researcher's `name`:

```jl
sco(
"""
approaches(li::Linguist, cs::ComputerScientist) = "Hey \$(cs.name), wanna do a paper? We need to use APA style."

approaches(cs::ComputerScientist, li::Linguist) = "Hey \$(li.name), wanna do a paper? We need to use IEEE style."
"""
)
```

Finally, let's instantiate our two researchers, `noam` and `judea`, as we did before in the Python case:

```jl
sc(
"""
noam = Linguist("Noam Chomsky", 92)
judea = ComputerScientist("Judea Pearl", 84)
"""
)
```

Again, let's see what Noam Chomsky will say when he approaches Judea Pearl with a paper idea:

```jl
sco(
"""
approaches(noam, judea)
"""
)
```

Perfect! It behaves just as we wanted!
This is **multiple dispatch** and it is an important feature in Julia.
Multiple dispatch acts on all arguments of a function and defines function behavior based on all argument's types.

---

Multiple dispatch is a powerful feature that allows us also to extend existing functions or to define custom and complex behavior to new types.
To show how this works, we'll use another example.
Suppose you want to define two new `struct`s for two different animals.
For simplicity, we won't be adding fields for the `struct`s:

```jl
sc(
"""
struct fox end
struct chicken end
"""
)
```

Next, we want to define addition for both `fox` and `chicken` new types.
We proceed by defining a new function signature of the `+` operator from the `Base` module of Julia^[this is just an example for teaching purposes. Doing something similar as this example will probably result in a [method invalidation](https://julialang.org/blog/2020/08/invalidations/).]:

```jl
sco(
"""
import Base: +
+(F::fox, C::chicken) = "trouble"
+(C1::chicken, C2::chicken) = "safe"
"""
)
```

Now let us call addition with the `+` sign on instantiated `fox` and `chicken` objects:

```jl
scob(
"""
my_fox = fox()
my_chicken = chicken()
my_fox + my_chicken
"""
)
```

And, as expected, adding two `chicken` objects together signals that they are safe:

```jl
scob(
"""
chicken_1 = chicken()
chicken_2 = chicken()
chicken_1 + chicken_2
"""
)
```

---

This is the power of multiple dispatch: **we don't need everything from scratch for our custom-defined user types**.
If you are excited as much as we are by multiple dispatch, here are two more in-depth examples.
The first is a [fast and elegant implementation of a one-hot vector](https://storopoli.io/Bayesian-Julia/pages/1_why_Julia/#example_one-hot_vector) by @storopoli2021bayesianjulia.
The second is an interview of [Christopher Rackauckas](https://www.chrisrackauckas.com/) at [Tanmay Bakshi YouTube's Channel](https://youtu.be/moyPIhvw4Nk?t=2107) (see from time 35:07 onwards) [@tanmaybakshiBakingKnowledgeMachine2021].
Chris mentions that, while using [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/), a package that he developed and currently maintains, a user reported that Julia has the best GPU-based quaternion ODE Solver and he said that he had no idea because he didn't even implemented it.
Most of the merit is due to multiple dispatch and high user code/type sharing.

To conclude, we think that multiple dispatch is best explained by one of the creators of Julia, [Stefan Karpinski, at JuliaCon 2019](https://youtu.be/kc9HwsxE1OY) [@thejuliaprogramminglanguageJuliaCon2019Unreasonable2019] (if you are reading the printed book or a static PDF please click on the link to go the video or check the citation):

## Julia in the Wild {#sec:julia_wild}

In @sec:julia_accomplish, we exposed why we think Julia is such a unique programming language.
We showed simple examples about the main features of Julia.
If you would like to have a deep dive on how Julia is being used, we have some **interesting use cases**:

1. NASA uses Julia in a supercomputer to analyze the ["Largest Batch of Earth-Sized Planets Ever Found"](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1669/seven-rocky-trappist-1-planets-may-be-made-of-similar-stuff/) and achieve a whopping **1,000x speedup** to catalog 188 million astronomical objects in 15 minutes.
2. [The Climate Modeling Alliance (CliMa)](https://clima.caltech.edu/) is using mostly Julia to **model climate in the GPU and CPU**.
Launched in 2018 in collaboration with researchers at Caltech, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Naval Postgraduate School, CliMA is utilizing recent progress in computational science to develop an Earth system model that can predict droughts, heat waves, and rainfall with unprecedented precision.
3. [US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is developing an **Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS-X)** using Julia](https://youtu.be/19zm1Fn0S9M).
This is a nice example of the "Two-Language Problem" (see @sec:julia_accomplish).
Previous solutions used Matlab to develop the algorithms and C++ for a fast implementation.
Now, FAA is using one language to do all this: Julia.
4. [**175x speedup** for Pfizer's pharmacology models using GPUs in Julia](https://juliacomputing.com/case-studies/pfizer/).
It was presented as a [poster](https://chrisrackauckas.com/assets/Posters/ACoP11_Poster_Abstracts_2020.pdf) in the 11th American Conference of Pharmacometrics (ACoP11) and [won a quality award](https://web.archive.org/web/20210121164011/https://www.go-acop.org/abstract-awards).
