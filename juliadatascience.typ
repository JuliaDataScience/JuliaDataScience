= Preface
<sec:preface>
There are many programming languages and each and every one of them has
its strengths and weaknesses. Some languages are very quick, but
verbose. Other languages are very easy to write in, but slow. This is
known as the #emph[two-language] problem and Julia aims at circumventing
this problem. Even though all three of us come from different fields, we
all found the Julia language more effective for our research than
languages that we’ve used before. We discuss some of our arguments in
Section~#link(<sec:why_julia>)[2];. However, compared to other
languages, Julia is one of the newest languages around. This means that
the ecosystem around the language is sometimes difficult to navigate
through. It’s difficult to figure out where to start and how all the
different packages fit together. That is why we decided to create this
book! We wanted to make it easier for researchers, and especially our
colleagues, to start using this awesome language.

As discussed above, each language has its strengths and weaknesses. In
our opinion, data science is definitely a strength of Julia. At the same
time, all three of us used data science tools in our day to day life.
And, probably, you want to use data science too! That is why this book
has a focus on data science.

In the next part of this section, we emphasize the #strong["data" part
of data science] and why data skills are, and will remain, in
#strong[high demand] in industry as well as in academia. We make an
argument for #strong[incorporating software engineering practices into
data science] which should reduce friction when updating and sharing
code with collaborators. Most data analyses are collaborative endeavors;
that is why these software practices will help you.

=== Data is Everywhere
<sec:data_everywhere>
#strong[Data is abundant] and will be even more so in the near future. A
report from late 2012 concluded that, from 2005 to 2020, the amount of
data stored digitally will #strong[grow by a factor of 300, from 130
exabytes#footnote[1 exabyte (EB) = 1,000,000 terabyte (TB).] to a
whopping 40,000 exabytes] @gantz2012digital. This is equal to 40
trillion gigabytes and, to put it into perspective, more than
#strong[5.2 terabytes for every living human currently on this planet!]
In 2020, on average, every person created #strong[1.7 MB of data per
second] @domo2018data. A recent report predicted that almost #strong[two
thirds (65%) of national GDPs will have undergone digitization by 2022]
@fitzgerald2020idc.

Every profession will be impacted by the increasing availability of data
and data’s increased importance @chen2014big@khan2014big. Data is used
to communicate and build knowledge, and to make decisions. This is why
data skills are important. If you become comfortable with handling data,
you will become a valuable researcher or professional. In other words,
you will become #strong[data literate];.

== What is Data Science?
<sec:why_data_science>
Data science is not only machine learning and statistics, and it’s not
all about prediction. Alas, it is not even a discipline fully contained
within STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields
@Meng2019Data. But one thing that we can assert with high confidence is
that data science is always about #strong[data];. Our aims of this book
are twofold:

- We focus on the backbone of data science: #strong[data];.
- We use the #strong[Julia] programming language to process the data.

We cover why Julia is an extremely effective language for data science
in Section~#link(<sec:why_julia>)[2];. For now, let’s turn our attention
towards data.

=== Data Literacy
<sec:data_literacy>
According to
#link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_literacy")[Wikipedia];, the
formal definition of #strong[data literacy is "the ability to read,
understand, create, and communicate data as information."];. We also
like the informal idea that, being data literate, you won’t feel
overwhelmed by data, but instead can use it to make the right decisions.
Data literacy can be seen as a highly competitive skill to possess. In
this book we’ll cover two aspects of data literacy:

+ #strong[Data Manipulation] with `DataFrames.jl` (Chapter
  #link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];) and `DataFramesMeta.jl` (Chapter
  #link(<sec:dataframesmeta>)[5];). In these chapters you will learn how
  to:
  + Read CSV and Excel data into Julia.
  + Process data in Julia, that is, learn how to answer data questions.
  + Filter and subset data.
  + Handle missing data.
  + Join multiple data sources together.
  + Group and summarize data.
  + Export data out of Julia to CSV and Excel files.
+ #strong[Data Visualization] with `Makie.jl` (Chapter
  #link(<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>)[6];). In this chapter you will
  learn how to:
  + Plot data with different `Makie.jl` backends.
  + Save visualizations in several formats such as PNG or PDF.
  + Use different plotting functions to make diverse data
    visualizations.
  + Customize visualizations with attributes.
  + Use and create new plotting themes.
  + Add \$\\LaTeX\$ elements to plots.
  + Manipulate color and palettes.
  + Create complex figure layouts.

== Software Engineering
<sec:engineering>
Unlike most books on data science, this book lays more emphasis on
properly #strong[structuring code];. The reason for this is that we
noticed that many data scientists simply place their code into one large
file and run all the statements sequentially. You can think of this like
forcing book readers to always read it from beginning to end, without
being allowed to revisit earlier sections or jump to interesting
sections right away. This works fine for small and simple projects, but,
as the project becomes bigger or more complex, more problems will start
to arise. For example, in a well-written book, the book is split into
distinctly-named chapters and sections which contain several references
to other parts in the book. The software equivalent of this is
#strong[splitting code into functions];. Each function has a name and
some contents. By using functions, you can tell the computer at any
point in your code to jump to some other place and continue from there.
This allows you to more easily re-use code between projects, update
code, share code, collaborate, and see the big picture. Hence, with
functions, you can #strong[save time];.

So, while reading this book, you will eventually get used to reading and
using functions. Another benefit of having good software engineering
skills is that it will allow you to more easily read the source code of
the packages that you’re using, which could be greatly beneficial when
you are debugging your code or wondering how exactly the package that
you’re using works. Finally, you can rest assured that we did not invent
this emphasis on functions ourselves. In industry, it is common practice
to encourage developers to use #strong["functions instead of comments"];.
This means that, instead of writing a comment for humans and some code
for the computer, the developers write a function which is read by both
humans and computers.

Also, we’ve put much effort into sticking to a consistent style guide.
Programming style guides provide guidelines for writing code; for
example, about where there should be whitespace and what names should be
capitalized or not. Sticking to a strict style guide might sound
pedantic and it sometimes is. However, the more consistent the code is,
the easier it is to read and understand the code. To read our code, you
don’t need to know our style guide. You’ll figure it out when reading.
If you do want to see the details of our style guide, check out
Section~#link(<sec:notation>)[8.2];.

= Why Julia?
<sec:why_julia>
The world of data science is filled with different open source
programming languages.

Industry has, mostly, adopted Python and academia R. #strong[Why bother
learning another language?] To answer this question, we will address two
common backgrounds:

+ #strong[Did not program before] – see
  Section~#link(<sec:non-programmers>)[2.1];.

+ #strong[Did program before] – see
  Section~#link(<sec:programmers>)[2.2];.

== For Non-Programmers
<sec:non-programmers>
In the first background, we expect the common underlying story to be the
following.

Data science has captivated you, making you interested in learning what
is it all about and how can you use it to build your career in academia
or industry. Then, you try to find resources to learn this new craft and
you stumble into a world of intricate acronyms: `pandas`, `dplyr`,
`data.table`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `ggplot2`, `bokeh`, and the list
goes on and on.

Out of the blue you hear a name: "Julia". What is this? How is it any
different from other tools that people tell you to use for data science?

Why should you dedicate your precious time into learning a language that
is almost never mentioned in any job listing, lab position, postdoc
offer, or academic job description? The answer is that #strong[Julia is
a fresh approach] to both programming and data science. Everything that
you do in Python or in R, you can do it in Julia with the advantage of
being able to write readable#footnote[no C++ or FORTRAN API calls.];,
fast, and powerful code. Therefore, the Julia language is gaining
traction, and for good reasons.

So, #strong[if you don’t have any programming background knowledge, we
highly encourage you to take up Julia] as a first programming language
and data science framework.

== For Programmers
<sec:programmers>
In the second background, the common underlying story changes a little
bit. You are someone who knows how to program and probably does this for
a living. You are familiar with one or more languages and can easily
switch between them. You’ve heard about this new flashy thing called
"data science" and you want to jump on the bandwagon. You begin to learn
how to do stuff in `numpy`, how to manipulate `DataFrames` in `pandas`
and how to plot things in `matplotlib`. Or maybe you’ve learned all that
in R by using the tidyverse and `tibbles`, `data.frames`, `%>%` (pipes)
and `geom_*`…

Then, from someone or somewhere you become aware of this new language
called "Julia". Why bother? You are already proficient in Python or R
and you can do everything that you need. Well, let us contemplate some
plausible scenarios.

#strong[Have you ever in Python or R:]

+ Done something and were unable to achieve the performance that you
  needed? Well, #strong[in Julia, Python or R minutes can be translated
  to seconds];#footnote[and sometimes milliseconds.];. We reserved
  Section~#link(<sec:julia_wild>)[2.4] for displaying successful Julia
  use cases in both academia and industry.

+ Tried to do something different from `numpy`/`dplyr` conventions and
  discovered that your code is slow and you’ll probably have to learn
  dark magic#footnote[`numba`, or even `Rcpp` or `cython`?] to make it
  faster? #strong[In Julia you can do your custom different stuff
  without loss of performance];.

+ Had to debug code and somehow you see yourself reading Fortran or
  C/C++ source code and having no idea what you are trying to
  accomplish? #strong[In Julia you only read Julia code, no need to
  learn another language to make your original language fast];. This is
  called the "two-language problem" (see
  Section~#link(<sec:two_language>)[2.3.2];). It also covers the use
  case for when "you had an interesting idea and wanted to contribute to
  an open source package and gave up because almost everything is not in
  Python or R but in C/C++ or Fortran"#footnote[have a look at some deep
  learning libraries in GitHub and you’ll be surprised that Python is
  only 25%-33% of the codebase.];.

+ Wanted to use a data structure defined in another package and found
  that doesn’t work and that you’ll probably need to build an
  interface#footnote[this is mostly a Python ecosystem problem, and
  while R doesn’t suffer heavily from this, it’s not blue skies
  either.];. #strong[Julia allows users to easily share and reuse code
  from different packages.] Most of Julia user-defined types and
  functions work right out of the box#footnote[or with little effort
  necessary.] and some users marvelled upon discovering how their
  packages are being used by other libraries in ways that they could not
  have imagined. We have some examples in
  Section~#link(<sec:multiple_dispatch>)[2.3.3];.

+ Needed to have a better project management, with dependencies and
  version control tightly controlled, manageable, and replicable?
  #strong[Julia has an amazing project management solution and a great
  package manager];. Unlike traditional package managers, which install
  and manage a single global set of packages, Julia’s package manager is
  designed around "environments": independent sets of packages that can
  be local to an individual project or shared between projects. Each
  project maintains its own independent set of package versions.

If we got your attention by exposing somewhat familiar or plausible
situations, you might be interested to learn more about this newcomer
called Julia.

Let’s proceed then!

== What Julia Aims to Accomplish?
<sec:julia_accomplish>
#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] In this section we will explain the details of
what makes Julia shine as a programming language. If it becomes too
technical for you, you can skip and go straight to
Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4] to learn about tabular data with
`DataFrames.jl`.
]

The Julia programming language @bezanson2017julia is a relatively new
language, first released in 2012, and aims to be #strong[both easy and
fast];. It "runs like C#footnote[sometimes even faster than C.] but
reads like Python" @perkelJuliaComeSyntax2019. It was made for
scientific computing, capable of handling #strong[large amounts of data
and computation] while still being fairly #strong[easy to manipulate,
create, and prototype code];.

The creators of Julia explained why they created Julia in a
#link("https://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia/")[2012 blogpost];.
They said:

#quote(block: true)[
We are greedy: we want more. We want a language that’s open source, with
a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We
want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with
obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something
as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as
R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear
algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell.
Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious
hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled.
]

Most users are attracted to Julia because of the #strong[superior
speed];. After all, Julia is a member of a prestigious and exclusive
club. The
#link("https://www.hpcwire.com/off-the-wire/julia-joins-petaflop-club/")[#strong[petaflop club];]
is comprised of languages who can exceed speeds of #strong[one
petaflop#footnote[a petaflop is one thousand trillion, or one
quadrillion, operations per second.] per second at peak performance];.
Currently only C, C++, Fortran, and Julia belong to the
#link("https://www.nextplatform.com/2017/11/28/julia-language-delivers-petascale-hpc-performance/")[petaflop club];.

But, speed is not all that Julia can deliver. The #strong[ease of use];,
#strong[Unicode support];, and a language that makes #strong[code
sharing effortless] are some of Julia’s features. We’ll address all
those features in this section, but we want to focus on the Julia code
sharing feature for now.

The Julia ecosystem of packages is something unique. It enables not only
code sharing but also allows sharing of user-created types. For example,
Python’s `pandas` uses its own `Datetime` type to handle dates. The same
with R tidyverse’s `lubridate` package, which also defines its own
`datetime` type to handle dates. Julia doesn’t need any of this, it has
all the date stuff already baked into its standard library. This means
that other packages don’t have to worry about dates. They just have to
extend Julia’s `DateTime` type to new functionalities by defining new
functions and do not need to define new types. Julia’s `Dates` module
can do amazing stuff, but we are getting ahead of ourselves now. Let’s
talk about some other features of Julia.

=== Julia Versus Other Programming Languages
<julia-versus-other-programming-languages>
In Figure~#link(<fig:language_comparison>)[1];, a highly opinionated
representation is shown that divides the main open source and scientific
computing languages in a 2x2 diagram with two axes: #strong[Slow-Fast]
and #strong[Easy-Hard];. We’ve omitted closed source languages because
there are many benefits to allowing other people to run your code for
free as well as being able to inspect the source code in case of issues.

We’ve put C++ and FORTRAN in the hard and fast quadrant. Being static
languages that need compilation, type checking, and other professional
care and attention, they are really hard to learn and slow to prototype.
The advantage is that they are #strong[really fast] languages.

R and Python go into the easy and slow quadrant. They are dynamic
languages that are not compiled and they execute in runtime. Because of
this, they are really easy to learn and fast to prototype. Of course,
this comes with a disadvantage: they are #strong[really slow] languages.

Julia is the only language in the easy and fast quadrant. We don’t know
any other serious language that would want to be hard and slow, so this
quadrant is left empty.

#figure(image("images/language_comparisons.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 1: Scientific Computing Language Comparisons: logos for
    FORTRAN, C++, Python, R and Julia.
  ]
)
<fig:language_comparison>

#strong[Julia is fast! Very fast!] It was designed for speed from the
beginning. In the rest of this section, we go into details about why
this is. If you don’t have (much) programming experience yet, feel free
to skip to the next section and maybe come later to this at a later
moment.

Julia accomplishes it’s speed partially due to multiple dispatch.
Basically, the idea is to generate very efficient LLVM#footnote[LLVM
stands for #strong[L];ow #strong[L];evel #strong[V];irtual
#strong[M];achine, you can find more at the LLVM website
(#link("http://llvm.org");).] code. LLVM code, also known as LLVM
instructions, are very low-level, that is, very close to the actual
operations that your computer is executing. So, in essence, Julia
converts your hand written and easy to read code to LLVM machine code
which is very hard for humans to read, but easy for computers to read.
For example, if you define a function taking one argument and pass an
integer into the function, then Julia will create a #emph[specialized]
`MethodInstance`. The next time that you pass an integer to the
function, Julia will look up the `MethodInstance` that was created
earlier and refer execution to that. Now, the #strong[great] trick is
that you can also do this inside a function that calls a function. For
example, if some data type is passed into function `outer` and `outer`
calls function `inner` and the data types passed to `inner` are known
inside the specialized `outer` instance, then the generated function
`inner` can be hardcoded into function `outer`! This means that Julia
doesn’t even have to lookup `MethodInstances` any more, and the code can
run very efficiently.

Let’s show this in practice. We can define the two functions, `inner`:

```language-julia
inner(x) = x + 3
```

and `outer`:

```language-julia
outer(x) = inner(2 * x)
```

For example, we can now calculate `outer` for, let’s say, 3:

```language-julia
outer(3)
```

```output

9
```

If you step through this calculation of `outer`, you’ll see that the
program needs do do quite a lot of things:

+ calculate `2 * 3`
+ pass the outcome of `2 * 3` to inner
+ calculate `3 + the outcome of the previous step`

But, if we ask Julia for the optimized code via `@code_typed`, we see
what instructions the computer actually get:

```julia
@code_llvm debuginfo=:none outer(3)
```

```output
define i64 @julia_outer_232(i64 signext %0) #0 {
top:
  %1 = shl i64 %0, 1
  %2 = add i64 %1, 3
  ret i64 %2
}
```

This is low-level LLVM code showing that the program only does the
following:

+ shift the input (3) one bit to the left, which has the same effect as
  multiplying by 2; and
+ add 3.

and that’s it! Julia has realized that calling `inner` can be removed,
so that’s not part of the calculation anymore! Now, imagine that this
function is called a thousand or even a million times. These
optimizations will reduce the running time significantly.

The trade-off, here, is that there are cases where earlier assumptions
about the hardcoded `MethodInstances` are invalidated. Then, the
`MethodInstance` has to be recreated which takes time. Also, the
trade-off is that it takes time to infer what can be hardcoded and what
not. This explains why it can often take very long before Julia does the
first thing: in the background, it is optimizing your code.

So, Julia creates optimized LLVM machine code#footnote[if you like to
learn more about how Julia is designed you should definitely check
#cite(<bezanson2017julia>, form: "prose");.];. You can find
#link("https://julialang.org/benchmarks/")[benchmarks] for Julia and
several other languages here. Figure~#link(<fig:benchmarks>)[2] was
taken from
#link("https://julialang.org/benchmarks/")[Julia’s website benchmarks section#footnote[please note that the Julia results depicted above do not include compile time.];];.
As you can see Julia is #strong[indeed] fast.

#figure(image("images/benchmarks.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 2: Julia versus other programming languages.
  ]
)
<fig:benchmarks>

We really believe in Julia. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be writing this book.
We think that Julia is the #strong[future of scientific computing and
scientific data analysis];. It enables the user to develop rapid and
powerful code with a simple syntax. Usually, researchers develop code by
prototyping using a very easy, but slow, language. Once the code is
assured to run correctly and fulfill its goal, then begins the process
of converting the code to a fast, but hard, language. This is known as
the "Two-Language Problem" and we discuss next.

=== The Two-Language Problem
<sec:two_language>
The "Two-Language Problem" is a very typical situation in scientific
computing where a researcher devises an algorithm or a solution to
tackle a desired problem or analysis at hand. Then, the solution is
prototyped in an easy to code language (like Python or R). If the
prototype works, the researcher would code in a fast language that would
not be easy to prototype (C++ or FORTRAN). Thus, we have two languages
involved in the process of developing a new solution. One which is easy
to prototype but is not suited for implementation (mostly due to being
slow). And another which is not so easy to code, and consequently not
easy to prototype, but suited for implementation because it is fast.
Julia avoids such situations by being the #strong[same language that you
prototype (ease of use) and implement the solution (speed)];.

Also, Julia lets you use #strong[Unicode characters as variables or
parameters];. This means no more using `sigma` or `sigma_i`, and instead
just use $sigma$ or $sigma ᵢ$ as you would in mathematical notation.
When you see code for an algorithm or for a mathematical equation, you
see almost the same notation and idioms. We call this feature
#strong["One-To-One Code and Math Relation"] which is a powerful
feature.

We think that the "Two-Language problem" and the "One-To-One Code and
Math Relation" are best described by one of the creators of Julia, Alan
Edelman, in a #link("https://youtu.be/qGW0GT1rCvs")[TEDx Talk]
@tedxtalksProgrammingLanguageHeal2020.

#block[
]
=== Multiple Dispatch
<sec:multiple_dispatch>
Multiple dispatch is a powerful feature that allows us to extend
existing functions or to define custom and complex behavior for new
types. Suppose that you want to define two new `struct`s to denote two
different animals:

```language-julia
abstract type Animal end
struct Fox <: Animal
    weight::Float64
end
struct Chicken <: Animal
    weight::Float64
end
```

Basically, this says "define a fox which is an animal" and "define a
chicken which is an animal". Next, we might have one fox called Fiona
and a chicken called Big Bird.

```language-julia
fiona = Fox(4.2)
big_bird = Chicken(2.9)
```

Next, we want to know how much they weight together, for which we can
write a function:

```language-julia
combined_weight(A1::Animal, A2::Animal) = A1.weight + A2.weight
```

```output
combined_weight (generic function with 1 method)
```

And we want to know whether they go well together. One way to implement
that is to use conditionals:

```language-julia
function naive_trouble(A::Animal, B::Animal)
    if A isa Fox && B isa Chicken
        return true
    elseif A isa Chicken && B isa Fox
        return true
    elseif A isa Chicken && B isa Chicken
        return false
    end
end
```

```output
naive_trouble (generic function with 1 method)
```

Now, let’s see whether leaving Fiona and Big Bird together would give
trouble:

```language-julia
naive_trouble(fiona, big_bird)
```

```output

true
```

Okay, so this sounds right. Writing the `naive_trouble` function seems
to be easy enough. However, using multiple dispatch to create a new
function `trouble` can have their benefits. Let’s create our new
function as follows:

```language-julia
trouble(F::Fox, C::Chicken) = true
trouble(C::Chicken, F::Fox) = true
trouble(C1::Chicken, C2::Chicken) = false
```

```output
trouble (generic function with 3 methods)
```

After defining these methods, `trouble` gives the same result as
`naive_trouble`. For example:

```language-julia
trouble(fiona, big_bird)
```

```output

true
```

And leaving Big Bird alone with another chicken called Dora is also fine

```language-julia
dora = Chicken(2.2)
trouble(dora, big_bird)
```

```output

false
```

So, in this case, the benefit of multiple dispatch is that you can just
declare types and Julia will find the correct method for your types.
Even more so, for many cases when multiple dispatch is used inside code,
the Julia compiler will actually optimize the function calls away. For
example, we could write:

```
function trouble(A::Fox, B::Chicken, C::Chicken)
    return trouble(A, B) || trouble(B, C) || trouble(C, A)
end
```

Depending on the context, Julia can optimize this to:

```
function trouble(A::Fox, B::Chicken, C::Chicken)
    return true || false || true
end
```

because the compiler #strong[knows] that `A` is a Fox, `B` is a chicken
and so this can be replaced by the contents of the method
`trouble(F::Fox, C::Chicken)`. The same holds for
`trouble(C1::Chicken, C2::Chicken)`. Next, the compiler can optimize
this to:

```
function trouble(A::Fox, B::Chicken, C::Chicken)
    return true
end
```

Another benefit of multiple dispatch is that when someone else now comes
by and wants to compare the existing animals to their animal, a Zebra,
then that’s possible. In their package, they can define a Zebra:

```language-julia
struct Zebra <: Animal
    weight::Float64
end
```

and also how the interactions with the existing animals would go:

```language-julia
trouble(F::Fox, Z::Zebra) = false
trouble(Z::Zebra, F::Fox) = false
trouble(C::Chicken, Z::Zebra) = false
trouble(Z::Zebra, F::Fox) = false
```

```output
trouble (generic function with 6 methods)
```

Now, we can see whether Marty (our zebra) is safe with Big Bird:

```language-julia
marty = Zebra(412)
trouble(big_bird, marty)
```

```output

false
```

Even better, we can also calculate #strong[the combined weight of
zebra’s and other animals without defining any extra function at our
side];:

```language-julia
combined_weight(big_bird, marty)
```

```output

414.9
```

So, in summary, the code that was written with only Fox and Chicken in
mind works even for types that it #strong[has never seen before];! In
practice, this means that Julia makes it often easy to re-use code from
other projects.

If you are excited as much as we are by multiple dispatch, here are two
more in-depth examples. The first is a
#link("https://storopoli.github.io/Bayesian-Julia/pages/01_why_Julia/#example_one-hot_vector")[fast and elegant implementation of a one-hot vector]
by #cite(<storopoli2021bayesianjulia>, form: "prose");. The second is an
interview with
#link("https://www.chrisrackauckas.com/")[Christopher Rackauckas] at
#link("https://youtu.be/moyPIhvw4Nk?t=2107")[Tanmay Bakshi YouTube’s Channel]
(see from time 35:07 onwards) @tanmaybakshiBakingKnowledgeMachine2021.
Chris mentions that, while using
#link("https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/")[`DifferentialEquations.jl`];, a
package that he developed and currently maintains, a user filed an issue
that his GPU-based quaternion ODE solver didn’t work. Chris was quite
surprised by this request since he would never have expected that
someone would combine GPU computations with quaternions and solving
ODEs. He was even more surprised to discover that the user made a small
mistake and that it all worked. Most of the merit is due to multiple
dispatch and high user code/type sharing.

To conclude, we think that multiple dispatch is best explained by one of
the creators of Julia:

== Julia in the Wild
<sec:julia_wild>
In Section~#link(<sec:julia_accomplish>)[2.3];, we explained why we
think Julia is such a unique programming language. We showed simple
examples about the main features of Julia. If you would like to have a
deep dive on how Julia is being used, we have some #strong[interesting
use cases];:

+ NASA uses Julia in a supercomputer to analyze the
  #link("https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/news/1669/seven-rocky-trappist-1-planets-may-be-made-of-similar-stuff/")["Largest Batch of Earth-Sized Planets Ever Found"]

= Julia Basics
<sec:julia_basics>
#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] In this chapter we cover the basics of Julia as a
programming language. Please note that this is not #emph[strictly
necessary] for you to use Julia as a tool for data manipulation and data
visualization. Having a basic understanding of Julia will definitely
make you more #emph[effective] and #emph[efficient] in using Julia.
However, if you prefer to get started straight away, you can jump to
Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4] to learn about tabular data with
`DataFrames.jl`.
]

This is going to be a very brief and #emph[not] an in-depth overview of
the Julia language. If you are already familiar and comfortable with
other programming languages, we highly encourage you to read Julia’s
documentation (#link("https://docs.julialang.org/");). The docs are an
excellent resource for taking a deep dive into Julia. It covers all the
basics and corner cases, but it can be cumbersome, especially if you
aren’t familiar with software documentation.

We’ll cover the basics of Julia. Imagine that Julia is a fancy
feature-loaded car, such as a brand-new Tesla. We’ll just explain to you
how to "drive the car, park it, and how to navigate in traffic". If you
want to know what "all the buttons in the steering wheel and dashboard
do", this is not the resource you are looking for.

== Development Environments
<sec:ide>
Before we can dive into the language syntax, we need to answer how to
run code. Going into details about the various options is out of scope
for this book. Instead, we will provide you with some pointers to
various solutions.

The simplest way is to use the Julia REPL. This means starting the Julia
executable (`julia` or `julia.exe`) and running code there. For example,
we can start the Julia REPL and execute some code:

```julia-repl
julia> x = 2
2

julia> x + 1
3
```

This works all very well, but what if we want to save the code that we
wrote? To save our code, one can write ".jl" files such as "script.jl"
and load these into Julia. Say, that "script.jl" contains:

```julia
x = 3
y = 4
```

We can load this into Julia:

```julia-repl
julia> include("script.jl")

julia> y
4
```

Now the problem becomes that we would like Julia to re-read our script
every time before executing code. This can be done via
#link("https://github.com/timholy/Revise.jl")[Revise.jl];. Because
compilation time in Julia is often long, `Revise.jl` is a must-have for
Julia development. For more information, see the `Revise.jl`
documentation or simply Google a bit if you have specific questions.

We are aware that `Revise.jl` and the REPL requires some manual actions
which aren’t super clearly documented. Luckily, there is
#link("https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl")[Pluto.jl];. `Pluto.jl`
automatically manages dependencies, runs code, and #strong[reacts] to
changes. For people who are new to programming, `Pluto.jl` is by far the
easiest way to get started. The main drawback of the package is that it
is less suitable for larger projects.

Other options are to use Visual Studio Code with various Julia
extensions or manage your own IDE. If you #strong[don’t] know what an
IDE is, but do want to manage large projects choose Visual Studio Code.
If you #strong[do] know what an IDE is, then you might like building
your own IDE with Vim or Emacs and the REPL.

So, to summarize:

- Easiest way to get started -\> `Pluto.jl`
- Larger projects -\> Visual Studio Code
- Advanced users -\> Vim, Emacs and the REPL

== Language Syntax
<sec:syntax>
Julia is a #strong[dynamic-typed language] with a just-in-time compiler.
This means that you don’t need to compile your program before you run
it, like you would do in C++ or FORTRAN. Instead, Julia will take your
code, guess types where necessary, and compile parts of code just before
running it. Also, you don’t need to explicitly specify each type. Julia
will guess types for you on the go.

The main differences between Julia and other dynamic languages such as R
and Python are the following. First, Julia #strong[allows the user to
specify type declarations];. You already saw some types declarations in
#emph[Why Julia?] (Section~#link(<sec:why_julia>)[2];): they are those
double colons `::` that sometimes come after variables. However, if you
don’t want to specify the type of your variables or functions, Julia
will gladly infer (guess) them for you.

Second, Julia allows users to define function behavior across many
combinations of argument types via multiple dispatch. We also covered
multiple dispatch in Section~#link(<sec:julia_accomplish>)[2.3];. We
defined a different type behavior by defining new function signatures
for argument types while using the same function name.

=== Variables
<sec:variable>
Variables are values that you tell the computer to store with a specific
name, so that you can later recover or change its value. Julia has
several types of variables but, in data science, we mostly use:

- Integers: `Int64`
- Real Numbers: `Float64`
- Boolean: `Bool`
- Strings: `String`

Integers and real numbers are stored by using 64 bits by default, that’s
why they have the `64` suffix in the name of the type. If you need more
or less precision, there are `Int8` or `Int128` types, for example,
where higher means more precision. Most of the time, this won’t be an
issue so you can just stick to the defaults.

We create new variables by writing the variable name on the left and its
value in the right, and in the middle we use the `=` assignment
operator. For example:

```language-julia
name = "Julia"
age = 9
```

```output

9
```

Note that the return output of the last statement (`age`) was printed to
the console. Here, we are defining two new variables: `name` and `age`.
We can recover their values by typing the names given in the assignment:

```language-julia
name
```

```output

Julia
```

If you want to define new values for an existing variable, you can
repeat the steps in the assignment. Note that Julia will now override
the previous value with the new one. Supposed, Julia’s birthday has
passed and now it has turned 10:

```language-julia
age = 10
```

```output

10
```

We can do the same with its `name`. Suppose that Julia has earned some
titles due to its blazing speed. We would change the variable `name` to
the new value:

```language-julia
name = "Julia Rapidus"
```

```output

Julia Rapidus
```

We can also do operations on variables such as addition or division.
Let’s see how old Julia is, in months, by multiplying `age` by 12:

```language-julia
12 * age
```

```output

120
```

We can inspect the types of variables by using the `typeof` function:

```language-julia
typeof(age)
```

```output
Int64
```

The next question then becomes: "What else can I do with integers?"
There is a nice handy function `methodswith` that spits out every
function available, along with its signature, for a certain type. Here,
we will restrict the output to the first 5 rows:

```language-julia
first(methodswith(Int64), 5)
```

```output
[1] AbstractFloat(x::Int64) @ Base float.jl:348
[2] Float16(x::Int64) @ Base float.jl:239
[3] Float32(x::Int64) @ Base float.jl:239
[4] Float64(x::Int64) @ Base float.jl:239
[5] Int64(x::Union{Bool, Int32, Int64, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64, UInt8, Int128, Int16, Int8, UInt128}) @ Core boot.jl:892
```

=== User-defined Types
<sec:struct>
Having variables around without any sort of hierarchy or relationships
is not ideal. In Julia, we can define that kind of structured data with
a `struct` (also known as a composite type). Inside each `struct`, you
can specify a set of fields. They differ from the primitive types
(e.g.~integer and floats) that are by default defined already inside the
core of Julia language. Since most `struct`s are user-defined, they are
known as user-defined types.

For example, let’s create a `struct` to represent scientific open source
programming languages. We’ll also define a set of fields along with the
corresponding types inside the `struct`:

```language-julia
struct Language
    name::String
    title::String
    year_of_birth::Int64
    fast::Bool
end
```

To inspect the field names you can use the `fieldnames` and pass the
desired `struct` as an argument:

```language-julia
fieldnames(Language)
```

```output
(:name, :title, :year_of_birth, :fast)
```

To use `struct`s, we must instantiate individual instances (or
"objects"), each with its own specific values for the fields defined
inside the `struct`. Let’s instantiate two instances, one for Julia and
one for Python:

```language-julia
julia = Language("Julia", "Rapidus", 2012, true)
python = Language("Python", "Letargicus", 1991, false)
```

```output
Language("Python", "Letargicus", 1991, false)
```

One thing to note with `struct`s is that we can’t change their values
once they are instantiated. We can solve this with a `mutable struct`.
Also, note that mutable objects will, generally, be slower and more
error prone. Whenever possible, make everything #emph[immutable];. Let’s
create a `mutable struct`.

```language-julia
mutable struct MutableLanguage
    name::String
    title::String
    year_of_birth::Int64
    fast::Bool
end

julia_mutable = MutableLanguage("Julia", "Rapidus", 2012, true)
```

```output
MutableLanguage("Julia", "Rapidus", 2012, true)
```

Suppose that we want to change `julia_mutable`’s title. Now, we can do
this since `julia_mutable` is an instantiated `mutable struct`:

```language-julia
julia_mutable.title = "Python Obliteratus"

julia_mutable
```

```output
MutableLanguage("Julia", "Python Obliteratus", 2012, true)
```

=== Boolean Operators and Numeric Comparisons
<boolean-operators-and-numeric-comparisons>
Now that we’ve covered types, we can move to boolean operators and
numeric comparison.

We have three boolean operators in Julia:

- `!`: #strong[NOT]
- `&&`: #strong[AND]
- `||`: #strong[OR]

Here are a few examples with some of them:

```language-julia
!true
```

```output

false
```

```language-julia
(false && true) || (!false)
```

```output

true
```

```language-julia
(6 isa Int64) && (6 isa Real)
```

```output

true
```

Regarding numeric comparison, Julia has three major types of
comparisons:

+ #strong[Equality];: either something is #emph[equal] or #emph[not
  equal] another
  - == "equal"
  - != or ≠ "not equal"
+ #strong[Less than];: either something is #emph[less than] or
  #emph[less than or equal to]
  - \< "less than"
  - \<= or ≤ "less than or equal to"
+ #strong[Greater than];: either something is #emph[greater than] or
  #emph[greater than or equal to]
  - \> "greater than"
  - \>= or ≥ "greater than or equal to"

Here are some examples:

```language-julia
1 == 1
```

```output

true
```

```language-julia
1 >= 10
```

```output

false
```

It evens works between different types:

```language-julia
1 == 1.0
```

```output

true
```

We can also mix and match boolean operators with numeric comparisons:

```language-julia
(1 != 10) || (3.14 <= 2.71)
```

```output

true
```

=== Functions
<sec:function>
Now that we already know how to define variables and custom types as
`struct`s, let’s turn our attention to #strong[functions];. In Julia, a
function #strong[maps argument’s values to one or more return values];.
The basic syntax goes like this:

```julia
function function_name(arg1, arg2)
    result = stuff with the arg1 and arg2
    return result
end
```

The function declaration begins with the keyword `function` followed by
the function name. Then, inside parentheses `()`, we define the
arguments separated by a comma `,`. Inside the function, we specify what
we want Julia to do with the parameters that we supplied. All variables
that we define inside a function are deleted after the function returns.
This is nice because it is like an automatic cleanup. After all the
operations in the function body are finished, we instruct Julia to
return the final result with the `return` statement. Finally, we let
Julia know that the function definition is finished with the `end`
keyword.

There is also the compact #strong[assignment form];:

```julia
f_name(arg1, arg2) = stuff with the arg1 and arg2
```

It is the #strong[same function] as before but with a different, more
compact, form. As a rule of thumb, when your code can fit easily on one
line of up to 92 characters, then the compact form is suitable.
Otherwise, just use the longer form with the `function` keyword. Let’s
dive into some examples.

==== Creating new Functions
<sec:function_example>
Let’s create a new function that adds numbers together:

```language-julia
function add_numbers(x, y)
    return x + y
end
```

```output
add_numbers (generic function with 1 method)
```

Now, we can use our `add_numbers` function:

```language-julia
add_numbers(17, 29)
```

```output

46
```

And it works also with floats:

```language-julia
add_numbers(3.14, 2.72)
```

```output

5.86
```

Also, we can define custom behavior by specifying type declarations.
Suppose that we want to have a `round_number` function that behaves
differently if its argument is either a `Float64` or `Int64`:

```language-julia
function round_number(x::Float64)
    return round(x)
end

function round_number(x::Int64)
    return x
end
```

```output
round_number (generic function with 2 methods)
```

We can see that it is a function with multiple methods:

```language-julia
methods(round_number)
```

```output
round_number(x::Int64)
     @ Main none:5
```

```output
round_number(x::Float64)
     @ Main none:1
```

There is one issue: what happens if we want to round a 32-bit float
`Float32`? Or a 8-bit integer `Int8`?

If you want something to function on all float and integer types, you
can use an #strong[abstract type] as the type signature, such as
`AbstractFloat` or `Integer`:

```language-julia
function round_number(x::AbstractFloat)
    return round(x)
end
```

```output
round_number (generic function with 3 methods)
```

Now, it works as expected with any float type:

```language-julia
x_32 = Float32(1.1)
round_number(x_32)
```

```output
1.0f0
```

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] We can inspect types with the `supertypes` and
`subtypes` functions.
]

Let’s go back to our `Language` `struct` that we defined above. This is
an example of multiple dispatch. We will extend the `Base.show` function
that prints the output of instantiated types and `struct`s.

By default, a `struct` has a basic output, which you saw above in the
`python` case. We can define a new `Base.show` method to our `Language`
type, so that we have some nice printing for our programming languages
instances. We want to clearly communicate programming languages’ names,
titles, and ages in years. The function `Base.show` accepts as arguments
a `IO` type named `io` followed by the type you want to define custom
behavior:

```language-julia
Base.show(io::IO, l::Language) = print(
    io, l.name, ", ",
    2021 - l.year_of_birth, " years old, ",
    "has the following titles: ", l.title
)
```

Now, let’s see how `python` will output:

```language-julia
python
```

```output
Python, 30 years old, has the following titles: Letargicus
```

==== Multiple Return Values
<sec:function_multiple>
A function can, also, return two or more values. See the new function
`add_multiply` below:

```language-julia
function add_multiply(x, y)
    addition = x + y
    multiplication = x * y
    return addition, multiplication
end
```

```output
add_multiply (generic function with 1 method)
```

In that case, we can do two things:

+ We can, analogously as the return values, define two variables to hold
  the function return values, one for each return value:

  ```language-julia
  return_1, return_2 = add_multiply(1, 2)
  return_2
  ```

  ```output

  2
  ```

+ Or we can define just one variable to hold the function’s return
  values and access them with either `first` or `last`:

  ```language-julia
  all_returns = add_multiply(1, 2)
  last(all_returns)
  ```

  ```output

  2
  ```

==== Keyword Arguments
<sec:function_keyword_arguments>
Some functions can accept keyword arguments instead of positional
arguments. These arguments are just like regular arguments, except that
they are defined after the regular function’s arguments and separated by
a semicolon `;`. For example, let’s define a `logarithm` function that
by default uses base $e$ (2.718281828459045) as a keyword argument. Note
that, here, we are using the abstract type `Real` so that we cover all
types derived from `Integer` and `AbstractFloat`, being both themselves
subtypes of `Real`:

```language-julia
AbstractFloat <: Real && Integer <: Real
```

```output

true
```

```language-julia
function logarithm(x::Real; base::Real=2.7182818284590)
    return log(base, x)
end
```

```output
logarithm (generic function with 1 method)
```

It works without specifying the `base` argument as we supplied a
#strong[default argument value] in the function declaration:

```language-julia
logarithm(10)
```

```output

2.3025850929940845
```

And also with the keyword argument `base` different from its default
value:

```language-julia
logarithm(10; base=2)
```

```output

3.3219280948873626
```

==== Anonymous Functions
<sec:function_anonymous>
Often we don’t care about the name of the function and want to quickly
make one. What we need are #strong[anonymous functions];. They are used
a lot in Julia’s data science workflow. For example, when using
`DataFrames.jl` (Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];) or `Makie.jl`
(Section~#link(<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>)[6];), sometimes we need a
temporary function to filter data or format plot labels. That’s when we
use anonymous functions. They are especially useful when we don’t want
to create a function, and a simple in-place statement would be enough.

The syntax is simple. We use the `->` operator. On the left of `->` we
define the parameter name. And on the right of `->` we define what
operations we want to perform on the parameter that we defined on the
left of `->`. Here is an example. Suppose that we want to undo the log
transformation by using an exponentiation:

```language-julia
map(x -> 2.7182818284590^x, logarithm(2))
```

```output

2.0
```

Here, we are using the `map` function to conveniently map the anonymous
function (first argument) to `logarithm(2)` (the second argument). As a
result, we get back the same number, because logarithm and
exponentiation are inverse (at least in the base that we’ve chosen –
2.7182818284590)

=== Conditional If-Else-Elseif
<sec:conditionals>
In most programming languages, the user is allowed to control the
computer’s flow of execution. Depending on the situation, we want the
computer to do one thing or another. In Julia we can control the flow of
execution with `if`, `elseif`, and `else` keywords. These are known as
conditional statements.

The `if` keyword prompts Julia to evaluate an expression and, depending
on whether it’s `true` or `false`, execute certain portions of code. We
can compound several `if` conditions with the `elseif` keyword for
complex control flow. Finally, we can define an alternative portion to
be executed if anything inside the `if` or `elseif`s is evaluated to
`true`. This is the purpose of the `else` keyword. Finally, like all the
previous keyword operators that we saw, we must tell Julia when the
conditional statement is finished with the `end` keyword.

Here’s an example with all the `if`-`elseif`-`else` keywords:

```language-julia
a = 1
b = 2

if a < b
    "a is less than b"
elseif a > b
    "a is greater than b"
else
    "a is equal to b"
end
```

```output

a is less than b
```

We can even wrap this in a function called `compare`:

```language-julia
function compare(a, b)
    if a < b
        "a is less than b"
    elseif a > b
        "a is greater than b"
    else
        "a is equal to b"
    end
end

compare(3.14, 3.14)
```

a is equal to b

=== For Loop
<sec:for>
The classical for loop in Julia follows a similar syntax as the
conditional statements. You begin with a keyword, in this case `for`.
Then, you specify what Julia should "loop" for, i.e., a sequence. Also,
like everything else, you must finish with the `end` keyword.

So, to make Julia print every number from 1 to 10, you can use the
following for loop:

```language-julia
for i in 1:10
    println(i)
end
```

=== While Loop
<sec:while>
The while loop is a mix of the previous conditional statements and for
loops. Here, the loop is executed every time the condition is `true`.
The syntax follows the same form as the previous one. We begin with the
keyword `while`, followed by a statement that evaluates to `true` or
`false`. As usual, you must end with the `end` keyword.

Here’s an example:

```language-julia
n = 0

while n < 3
    global n += 1
end

n
```

```output

3
```

As you can see, we have to use the `global` keyword. This is because of
#strong[variable scope];. Variables defined inside conditional
statements, loops, and functions exist only inside them. This is known
as the #emph[scope] of the variable. Here, we had to tell Julia that the
`n` inside `while` loop is in the global scope with the `global`
keyword.

Finally, we also used the `+=` operator which is a nice shorthand for
`n = n + 1`.

== Native Data Structures
<sec:data_structures>
Julia has several native data structures. They are abstractions of data
that represent some form of structured data. We will cover the most used
ones. They hold homogeneous or heterogeneous data. Since they are
collections, they can be #emph[looped] over with the `for` loops.

We will cover `String`, `Tuple`, `NamedTuple`, `UnitRange`, `Arrays`,
`Pair`, `Dict`, `Symbol`.

When you stumble across a data structure in Julia, you can find methods
that accept it as an argument with the `methodswith` function. In Julia,
the distinction between methods and functions is as follows. Every
function can have multiple methods like we have shown earlier. The
`methodswith` function is nice to have in your bag of tricks. Let’s see
what we can do with a `String` for example:

```language-julia
first(methodswith(String), 5)
```

```output
[1] String(s::String) @ Core boot.jl:420
[2] Symbol(s::String) @ Core boot.jl:618
[3] ==(y::PosLenString, x::String) @ WeakRefStrings ~/.julia/packages/WeakRefStrings/31nkb/src/poslenstrings.jl:84
[4] ==(x::String, y::PosLenString) @ WeakRefStrings ~/.julia/packages/WeakRefStrings/31nkb/src/poslenstrings.jl:72
[5] ==(a::String, b::String) @ Base strings/string.jl:162
```

=== Broadcasting Operators and Functions
<sec:broadcasting>
Before we dive into data structures, we need to talk about broadcasting
(also known as #emph[vectorization];) and the "dot" operator `.`.

We can broadcast mathematical operations like `*` (multiplication) or
`+` (addition) using the dot operator. For example, broadcasted addition
would imply a change from `+` to `.+`:

```language-julia
[1, 2, 3] .+ 1
```

```output
[2, 3, 4]
```

It also works automatically with functions. (Technically, the
mathematical operations, or infix operators, are also functions, but
that is not so important to know.) Remember our `logarithm` function?

```language-julia
logarithm.([1, 2, 3])
```

```output
[0.0, 0.6931471805599569, 1.0986122886681282]
```

=== Functions with a bang `!`
<sec:function_bang>
It is a Julia convention to append a bang `!` to names of functions that
modify one or more of their arguments. This convention warns the user
that the function is #strong[not pure];, i.e., that it has #emph[side
effects];. A function with side effects is useful when you want to
update a large data structure or variable container without having all
the overhead from creating a new instance.

For example, we can create a function that adds 1 to each element in a
vector `V`:

```language-julia
function add_one!(V)
    for i in eachindex(V)
        V[i] += 1
    end
    return nothing
end
```

```language-julia
my_data = [1, 2, 3]

add_one!(my_data)

my_data
```

```output
[2, 3, 4]
```

=== String
<sec:string>
#strong[Strings] are represented delimited by double quotes:

```language-julia
typeof("This is a string")
```

```output
String
```

We can also write a multiline string:

```language-julia
text = "
This is a big multiline string.
As you can see.
It is still a String to Julia.
"
```

```output


This is a big multiline string.
As you can see.
It is still a String to Julia.

```

But it is usually clearer to use triple quotation marks:

```language-julia
s = """
    This is a big multiline string with a nested "quotation".
    As you can see.
    It is still a String to Julia.
    """
```

```output

This is a big multiline string with a nested "quotation".
As you can see.
It is still a String to Julia.

```

When using triple-backticks, the indentation and newline at the start is
ignored by Julia. This improves code readability because you can indent
the block in your source code without those spaces ending up in your
string.

==== String Concatenation
<sec:string_concatenation>
A common string operation is #strong[string concatenation];. Suppose
that you want to construct a new string that is the concatenation of two
or more strings. This is accomplished in Julia either with the `*`
operator or the `join` function. This symbol might sound like a weird
choice and it actually is. For now, many Julia codebases are using this
symbol, so it will stay in the language. If you’re interested, you can
read a discussion from 2015 about it at
#link("https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/11030");.

```language-julia
hello = "Hello"
goodbye = "Goodbye"

hello * goodbye
```

```output

HelloGoodbye
```

As you can see, we are missing a space between `hello` and `goodbye`. We
could concatenate an additional `" "` string with the `*`, but that
would be cumbersome for more than two strings. That’s where the `join`
function comes in handy. We just pass as arguments the strings inside
the brackets `[]` and the separator:

```language-julia
join([hello, goodbye], " ")
```

```output

Hello Goodbye
```

==== String Interpolation
<sec:string_interpolation>
Concatenating strings can be convoluted. We can be much more expressive
with #strong[string interpolation];. It works like this: you specify
whatever you want to be included in your string with the dollar sign
`$`. Here’s the example before but now using interpolation:

```language-julia
"$hello $goodbye"
```

```output

Hello Goodbye
```

It even works inside functions. Let’s revisit our `test` function from
Section~#link(<sec:conditionals>)[3.2.5];:

```language-julia
function test_interpolated(a, b)
    if a < b
        "$a is less than $b"
    elseif a > b
        "$a is greater than $b"
    else
        "$a is equal to $b"
    end
end

test_interpolated(3.14, 3.14)
```

```output

3.14 is equal to 3.14
```

==== String Manipulations
<sec:string_manipulations>
There are several functions to manipulate strings in Julia. We will
demonstrate the most common ones. Also, note that most of these
functions accept a
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/#Regular-Expressions")[Regular Expression (regex)]
as arguments. We won’t cover Regular Expressions in this book, but you
are encouraged to learn about them, especially if most of your work uses
textual data.

First, let us define a string for us to play around with:

```language-julia
julia_string = "Julia is an amazing open source programming language"
```

```output

Julia is an amazing open source programming language
```

+ `contains`, `startswith` and `endswith`: A conditional (returns either
  `true` or `false`) if the second argument is a:

  - #strong[substring] of the first argument

    ```language-julia
    contains(julia_string, "Julia")
    ```

    ```output

    true
    ```

  - #strong[prefix] of the first argument

    ```language-julia
    startswith(julia_string, "Julia")
    ```

    ```output

    true
    ```

  - #strong[suffix] of the first argument

    ```language-julia
    endswith(julia_string, "Julia")
    ```

    ```output

    false
    ```

+ `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `titlecase` and `lowercasefirst`:

  ```language-julia
  lowercase(julia_string)
  ```

  ```output

  julia is an amazing open source programming language
  ```

  ```language-julia
  uppercase(julia_string)
  ```

  ```output

  JULIA IS AN AMAZING OPEN SOURCE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
  ```

  ```language-julia
  titlecase(julia_string)
  ```

  ```output

  Julia Is An Amazing Open Source Programming Language
  ```

  ```language-julia
  lowercasefirst(julia_string)
  ```

  ```output

  julia is an amazing open source programming language
  ```

+ `replace`: introduces a new syntax, called the `Pair`

  ```language-julia
  replace(julia_string, "amazing" => "awesome")
  ```

  ```output

  Julia is an awesome open source programming language
  ```

+ `split`: breaks up a string by a delimiter:

  ```language-julia
  split(julia_string, " ")
  ```

  ```output
  SubString{String}["Julia", "is", "an", "amazing", "open", "source", "programming", "language"]
  ```

==== String Conversions
<sec:string_conversions>
Often, we need to #strong[convert] between types in Julia. To convert a
number to a string we can use the `string` function:

```language-julia
my_number = 123
typeof(string(my_number))
```

```output
String
```

Sometimes, we want the opposite: convert a string to a number. Julia has
a handy function for that: `parse`.

```language-julia
typeof(parse(Int64, "123"))
```

```output
Int64
```

Sometimes, we want to play safe with these conversions. That’s when
`tryparse` function steps in. It has the same functionality as `parse`
but returns either a value of the requested type, or `nothing`. That
makes `tryparse` handy when we want to avoid errors. Of course, you
would need to deal with all those `nothing` values afterwards.

```language-julia
tryparse(Int64, "A very non-numeric string")
```

```output
nothing
```

=== Tuple
<sec:tuple>
Julia has a data structure called #strong[tuple];. They are really
#emph[special] in Julia because they are often used in relation to
functions. Since functions are an important feature in Julia, every
Julia user should know the basics of tuples.

A tuple is a #strong[fixed-length container that can hold multiple
different types];. A tuple is an #strong[immutable object];, meaning
that it cannot be modified after instantiation. To construct a tuple,
use parentheses `()` to delimit the beginning and end, along with commas
`,` as delimiters between values:

```language-julia
my_tuple = (1, 3.14, "Julia")
```

```output
(1, 3.14, "Julia")
```

Here, we are creating a tuple with three values. Each one of the values
is a different type. We can access them via indexing. Like this:

```language-julia
my_tuple[2]
```

```output

3.14
```

We can also loop over tuples with the `for` keyword. And even apply
functions to tuples. But we can #strong[never change any value of a
tuple] since they are #strong[immutable];.

Remember functions that return multiple values back in
Section~#link(<sec:function_multiple>)[3.2.4.2];? Let’s inspect what our
`add_multiply` function returns:

```language-julia
return_multiple = add_multiply(1, 2)
typeof(return_multiple)
```

```output
Tuple{Int64, Int64}
```

This is because `return a, b` is the same as `return (a, b)`:

```language-julia
1, 2
```

```output
(1, 2)
```

So, now you can see why they are often related.

One more thing about tuples. #strong[When you want to pass more than one
variable to an anonymous function, guess what you would need to use?
Once again: tuples!]

```language-julia
map((x, y) -> x^y, 2, 3)
```

```output

8
```

Or, even more than two arguments:

```language-julia
map((x, y, z) -> x^y + z, 2, 3, 1)
```

```output

9
```

=== Named Tuple
<sec:namedtuple>
Sometimes, you want to name the values in tuples. That’s when
#strong[named tuples] comes in. Their functionality is pretty much same
as tuples: they are #strong[immutable] and can hold #strong[any type of
value];.

The construction of named tuples is slightly different from that of
tuples. You have the familiar parentheses `()` and the comma `,` value
separator. But now you #strong[name the values];:

```language-julia
my_namedtuple = (i=1, f=3.14, s="Julia")
```

```output
(i = 1, f = 3.14, s = "Julia")
```

We can access named tuple’s values via indexing like regular tuples or,
alternatively, #strong[access by their names] with the `.`:

```language-julia
my_namedtuple.s
```

```output

Julia
```

To finish our discussion of named tuples, there is one important
#emph[quick] syntax that you’ll see a lot in Julia code. Often Julia
users create a named tuple by using the familiar parenthesis `()` and
commas `,`, but without naming the values. To do so you #strong[begin
the named tuple construction by specifying first a semicolon `;` before
the values];. This is especially useful when the values that would
compose the named tuple are already defined in variables or when you
want to avoid long lines:

```language-julia
i = 1
f = 3.14
s = "Julia"

my_quick_namedtuple = (; i, f, s)
```

```output
(i = 1, f = 3.14, s = "Julia")
```

=== Ranges
<sec:ranges>
A #strong[range] in Julia represents an interval between start and stop
boundaries. The syntax is `start:stop`:

```language-julia
1:10
```

```output
1:10
```

As you can see, our instantiated range is of type `UnitRange{T}` where
`T` is the type inside the `UnitRange`:

```language-julia
typeof(1:10)
```

```output
UnitRange{Int64}
```

And, if we gather all the values, we get:

```language-julia
[x for x in 1:10]
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

We can also construct ranges for other types:

```language-julia
typeof(1.0:10.0)
```

```output
StepRangeLen{Float64, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Base.TwicePrecision{Float64}, Int64}
```

Sometimes, we want to change the default interval step size behavior. We
can do that by adding a step size in the range syntax `start:step:stop`.
For example, suppose we want a range of `Float64` from 0 to 1 with steps
of size 0.2:

```language-julia
0.0:0.2:1.0
```

```output
0.0:0.2:1.0
```

If you want to "materialize" a range into a collection, you can use the
function `collect`:

```language-julia
collect(1:10)
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

We have an array of the type specified in the range between the
boundaries that we’ve set. Speaking of arrays, let’s talk about them.

=== Array
<sec:array>
In its most basic form, #strong[array];s hold multiple objects. For
example, they can hold multiple numbers in one-dimension:

```language-julia
myarray = [1, 2, 3]
```

```output
[1, 2, 3]
```

Most of the time you would want #strong[arrays of a single type for
performance issues];, but note that they can also hold objects of
different types:

```language-julia
myarray = ["text", 1, :symbol]
```

```output
Any["text", 1, :symbol]
```

They are the "bread and butter" of data scientist, because arrays are
what underlies most of #strong[data manipulation] and #strong[data
visualization] workflows.

Therefore, #strong[Arrays are an essential data structure];.

==== Array Types
<sec:array_types>
Let’s start with #strong[array types];. There are several, but we will
focus on the two most used in data science:

- `Vector{T}`: #strong[one-dimensional] array. Alias for `Array{T, 1}`.
- `Matrix{T}`: #strong[two-dimensional] array. Alias for `Array{T, 2}`.

Note here that `T` is the type of the underlying array. So, for example,
`Vector{Int64}` is a `Vector` in which all elements are `Int64`s, and
`Matrix{AbstractFloat}` is a `Matrix` in which all elements are subtypes
of `AbstractFloat`.

Most of the time, especially when dealing with tabular data, we are
using either one- or two-dimensional arrays. They are both `Array` types
for Julia. But, we can use the handy aliases `Vector` and `Matrix` for
clear and concise syntax.

==== Array Construction
<sec:array_construction>
How do we #strong[construct] an array? In this section, we start by
constructing arrays in a low-level way. This can be necessary to write
high performing code in some situations. However, in most situations,
this is not necessary, and we can safely use more convenient methods to
create arrays. These more convenient methods will be described later in
this section.

The low-level constructor for Julia arrays is the #strong[default
constructor];. It accepts the element type as the type parameter inside
the `{}` brackets and inside the constructor you’ll pass the element
type followed by the desired dimensions. It is common to initialize
vector and matrices with undefined elements by using the `undef`
argument for type. A vector of 10 `undef` `Float64` elements can be
constructed as:

```language-julia
my_vector = Vector{Float64}(undef, 10)
```

```output
[1.0253483661944e-310, 1.02534836643315e-310, 1.02534836643315e-310, 1.02534836643315e-310, 1.02534836620074e-310, 2.71615463631e-312, 0.0, 1.0253483661944e-310, 1.02534836643315e-310, 3.8735e-320]
```

For matrices, since we are dealing with two-dimensional objects, we need
to pass two dimension arguments inside the constructor: one for
#strong[rows] and another for #strong[columns];. For example, a matrix
with 10 rows and 2 columns of `undef` elements can be instantiated as:

```language-julia
my_matrix = Matrix{Float64}(undef, 10, 2)
```

```output
10×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
 6.91208e-310  6.91208e-310
```

We also have some #strong[syntax aliases] for the most common elements
in array construction:

- `zeros` for all elements being initialized to zero. Note that the
  default type is `Float64` which can be changed if necessary:

  ```language-julia
  my_vector_zeros = zeros(10)
  ```

  ```output
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  ```

  ```language-julia
  my_matrix_zeros = zeros(Int64, 10, 2)
  ```

  ```output
  10×2 Matrix{Int64}:
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
   0  0
  ```

- `ones` for all elements being initialized to one:

  ```language-julia
  my_vector_ones = ones(Int64, 10)
  ```

  ```output
  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
  ```

  ```language-julia
  my_matrix_ones = ones(10, 2)
  ```

  ```output
  10×2 Matrix{Float64}:
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
   1.0  1.0
  ```

For other elements, we can first instantiate an array with `undef`
elements and use the `fill!` function to fill all elements of an array
with the desired element. Here’s an example with `3.14` ($pi$):

```language-julia
my_matrix_π = Matrix{Float64}(undef, 2, 2)
fill!(my_matrix_π, 3.14)
```

```output
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 3.14  3.14
 3.14  3.14
```

We can also create arrays with #strong[array literals];. For example,
here’s a 2x2 matrix of integers:

```language-julia
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]
```

```output
2×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  2
 3  4
```

Array literals also accept a type specification before the `[]`
brackets. So, if we want the same 2x2 array as before but now as floats,
we can do so:

```language-julia
Float64[[1 2]
        [3 4]]
```

```output
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 1.0  2.0
 3.0  4.0
```

It also works for vectors:

```language-julia
Bool[0, 1, 0, 1]
```

```output
Bool[0, 1, 0, 1]
```

You can even #strong[mix and match] array literals with the
constructors:

```language-julia
[ones(Int, 2, 2) zeros(Int, 2, 2)]
```

```output
2×4 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1  0  0
 1  1  0  0
```

```language-julia
[zeros(Int, 2, 2)
 ones(Int, 2, 2)]
```

```output
4×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 0  0
 0  0
 1  1
 1  1
```

```language-julia
[ones(Int, 2, 2) [1; 2]
 [3 4]            5]
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  1  1
 1  1  2
 3  4  5
```

Another powerful way to create an array is to write an #strong[array
comprehension];. This way of creating arrays is better in most cases: it
avoids loops, indexing, and other error-prone operations. You specify
what you want to do inside the `[]` brackets. For example, say we want
to create a vector of squares from 1 to 10:

```language-julia
[x^2 for x in 1:10]
```

```output
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

They also support multiple inputs:

```language-julia
[x*y for x in 1:10 for y in 1:2]
```

```output
[1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6, 4, 8, 5, 10, 6, 12, 7, 14, 8, 16, 9, 18, 10, 20]
```

And conditionals:

```language-julia
[x^2 for x in 1:10 if isodd(x)]
```

```output
[1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```

As with array literals, you can specify your desired type before the
`[]` brackets:

```language-julia
Float64[x^2 for x in 1:10 if isodd(x)]
```

```output
[1.0, 9.0, 25.0, 49.0, 81.0]
```

Finally, we can also create arrays with #strong[concatenation
functions];. Concatenation is a standard term in computer programming
and means "to chain together". For example, we can concatenate strings
with "aa" and "bb" to get "aabb":

```language-julia
"aa" * "bb"
```

aabb

And, we can concatenate arrays to create new arrays:

- `cat`: concatenate input arrays along a specific dimension `dims`

  ```language-julia
  cat(ones(2), zeros(2), dims=1)
  ```

  ```output
  [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  ```

  ```language-julia
  cat(ones(2), zeros(2), dims=2)
  ```

  ```output
  2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
   1.0  0.0
   1.0  0.0
  ```

- `vcat`: vertical concatenation, a shorthand for `cat(...; dims=1)`

  ```language-julia
  vcat(ones(2), zeros(2))
  ```

  ```output
  [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  ```

- `hcat`: horizontal concatenation, a shorthand for `cat(...; dims=2)`

  ```language-julia
  hcat(ones(2), zeros(2))
  ```

  ```output
  2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
   1.0  0.0
   1.0  0.0
  ```

==== Array Inspection
<sec:array_inspection>
Once we have arrays, the next logical step is to #strong[inspect] them.
There are a lot of handy functions that allow the user to have an
insight into any array.

It is most useful to know what #strong[type of elements] are inside an
array. We can do this with `eltype`:

```language-julia
eltype(my_matrix_π)
```

```output
Float64
```

After knowing its types, one might be interested in #strong[array
dimensions];. Julia has several functions to inspect array dimensions:

- `length`: total number of elements

  ```language-julia
  length(my_matrix_π)
  ```

  ```output

  4
  ```

- `ndims`: number of dimensions

  ```language-julia
  ndims(my_matrix_π)
  ```

  ```output

  2
  ```

- `size`: this one is a little tricky. By default it will return a tuple
  containing the array’s dimensions.

  ```language-julia
  size(my_matrix_π)
  ```

  ```output
  (2, 2)
  ```

  You can get a specific dimension with a second argument to `size`.
  Here, the the second axis is columns

  ```language-julia
  size(my_matrix_π, 2)
  ```

  ```output

  2
  ```

==== Array Indexing and Slicing
<sec:array_indexing>
Sometimes, we want to inspect only certain parts of an array. This is
called #strong[indexing] and #strong[slicing];. If you want a particular
observation of a vector, or a row or column of a matrix, you’ll probably
need to #strong[index an array];.

First, we will create an example vector and matrix to play around:

```language-julia
my_example_vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

my_example_matrix = [[1 2 3]
                     [4 5 6]
                     [7 8 9]]
```

Let’s start with vectors. Suppose that you want the second element of a
vector. You append `[]` brackets with the desired #strong[index] inside:

```language-julia
my_example_vector[2]
```

```output

2
```

The same syntax follows with matrices. But, since matrices are
2-dimensional arrays, we have to specify #emph[both] rows and columns.
Let’s retrieve the element from the second row (first dimension) and
first column (second dimension):

```language-julia
my_example_matrix[2, 1]
```

```output

4
```

Julia also has conventional keywords for the #strong[first] and
#strong[last] elements of an array: `begin` and `end`. For example, the
second to last element of a vector can be retrieved as:

```language-julia
my_example_vector[end-1]
```

```output

4
```

This also works for matrices. Let’s retrieve the element of the last row
and second column:

```language-julia
my_example_matrix[end, begin+1]
```

```output

8
```

Often, we are not only interested in just one array element, but in a
whole #strong[subset of array elements];. We can accomplish this by
#strong[slicing] an array. It uses the same index syntax, but with the
added colon `:` to denote the boundaries that we are slicing through the
array. For example, suppose we want to get the 2nd to 4th element of a
vector:

```language-julia
my_example_vector[2:4]
```

```output
[2, 3, 4]
```

We could do the same with matrices. Particularly with matrices if we
want to select #strong[all elements] in a following dimension we can do
so with just a colon `:`. For example, to get all the elements in the
second row:

```language-julia
my_example_matrix[2, :]
```

```output
[4, 5, 6]
```

You can interpret this with something like "take the 2nd row and all the
columns".

It also supports `begin` and `end`:

```language-julia
my_example_matrix[begin+1:end, end]
```

```output
[6, 9]
```

==== Array Manipulations
<sec:array_manipulation>
There are several ways we could #strong[manipulate] an array. The first
would be to manipulate a #strong[singular element of the array];. We
just index the array by the desired element and proceed with an
assignment `=`:

```language-julia
my_example_matrix[2, 2] = 42
my_example_matrix
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 1   2  3
 4  42  6
 7   8  9
```

Or, you can manipulate a certain #strong[subset of elements of the
array];. In this case, we need to slice the array and then assign with
`=`:

```language-julia
my_example_matrix[3, :] = [17, 16, 15]
my_example_matrix
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  1   2   3
  4  42   6
 17  16  15
```

Note that we had to assign a vector because our sliced array is of type
`Vector`:

```language-julia
typeof(my_example_matrix[3, :])
```

```output
Vector{Int64} (alias for Array{Int64, 1})
```

The second way we could manipulate an array is to #strong[alter its
shape];. Suppose that you have a 6-element vector and you want to make
it a 3x2 matrix. You can do this with `reshape`, by using the array as
the first argument and a tuple of dimensions as the second argument:

```language-julia
six_vector = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
three_two_matrix = reshape(six_vector, (3, 2))
three_two_matrix
```

```output
3×2 Matrix{Int64}:
 1  4
 2  5
 3  6
```

You can convert it back to a vector by specifying a tuple with only one
dimension as the second argument:

```language-julia
reshape(three_two_matrix, (6, ))
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

The third way we could manipulate an array is to #strong[apply a
function over every array element];. This is where the "dot" operator
`.`, also known as #emph[broadcasting];, comes in.

```language-julia
logarithm.(my_example_matrix)
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0      0.693147  1.09861
 1.38629  3.73767   1.79176
 2.83321  2.77259   2.70805
```

The dot operator in Julia is extremely versatile. You can even use it to
broadcast infix operators:

```language-julia
my_example_matrix .+ 100
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 101  102  103
 104  142  106
 117  116  115
```

An alternative to broadcasting a function over a vector is to use `map`:

```language-julia
map(logarithm, my_example_matrix)
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Float64}:
 0.0      0.693147  1.09861
 1.38629  3.73767   1.79176
 2.83321  2.77259   2.70805
```

For anonymous functions, `map` is usually more readable. For example,

```language-julia
map(x -> 3x, my_example_matrix)
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  3    6   9
 12  126  18
 51   48  45
```

is quite clear. However, the same broadcast looks as follows:

```language-julia
(x -> 3x).(my_example_matrix)
```

```output
3×3 Matrix{Int64}:
  3    6   9
 12  126  18
 51   48  45
```

Next, `map` works with slicing:

```language-julia
map(x -> x + 100, my_example_matrix[:, 3])
```

```output
[103, 106, 115]
```

Finally, sometimes, and specially when dealing with tabular data, we
want to apply a #strong[function over all elements in a specific array
dimension];. This can be done with the `mapslices` function. Similar to
`map`, the first argument is the function and the second argument is the
array. The only change is that we need to specify the `dims` argument to
flag what dimension we want to transform the elements.

For example, let’s use `mapslices` with the `sum` function on both rows
(`dims=1`) and columns (`dims=2`):

```language-julia
# rows
mapslices(sum, my_example_matrix; dims=1)
```

```output
1×3 Matrix{Int64}:
 22  60  24
```

```language-julia
# columns
mapslices(sum, my_example_matrix; dims=2)
```

```output
3×1 Matrix{Int64}:
  6
 52
 48
```

==== Array Iteration
<sec:array_iteration>
One common operation is to #strong[iterate over an array with a `for`
loop];. The #strong[regular `for` loop over an array returns each
element];.

The simplest example is with a vector.

```language-julia
simple_vector = [1, 2, 3]

empty_vector = Int64[]

for i in simple_vector
    push!(empty_vector, i + 1)
end

empty_vector
```

```output
[2, 3, 4]
```

Sometimes, you don’t want to loop over each element, but actually over
each array index. #strong[We can use the `eachindex` function combined
with a `for` loop to iterate over each array index];.

Again, let’s show an example with a vector:

```language-julia
forty_twos = [42, 42, 42]

empty_vector = Int64[]

for i in eachindex(forty_twos)
    push!(empty_vector, i)
end

empty_vector
```

```output
[1, 2, 3]
```

In this example, the `eachindex(forty_twos)` returns the indices of
`forty_twos`, namely `[1, 2, 3]`.

Similarly, we can iterate over matrices. The standard `for` loop goes
first over columns then over rows. It will first traverse all elements
in column 1, from the first row to the last row, then it will move to
column 2 in a similar fashion until it has covered all columns.

For those familiar with other programming languages: Julia, like most
scientific programming languages, is "column-major". Column-major means
that the elements in the column are stored next to each other in
memory#footnote[or, that the memory address pointers to the elements in
the column are stored next to each other.];. This also means that
iterating over elements in a column is much quicker than over elements
in a row.

Ok, let’s show this in an example:

```language-julia
column_major = [[1 3]
                [2 4]]

row_major = [[1 2]
             [3 4]]
```

If we loop over the vector stored in column-major order, then the output
is sorted:

```language-julia
indexes = Int64[]

for i in column_major
    push!(indexes, i)
end

indexes
```

```output
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

However, the output isn’t sorted when looping over the other matrix:

```language-julia
indexes = Int64[]

for i in row_major
    push!(indexes, i)
end

indexes
```

```output
[1, 3, 2, 4]
```

It is often better to use specialized functions for these loops:

- `eachcol`: iterates over an array column first

  ```language-julia
  first(eachcol(column_major))
  ```

  ```output
  [1, 2]
  ```

- `eachrow`: iterates over an array row first

  ```language-julia
  first(eachrow(column_major))
  ```

  ```output
  [1, 3]
  ```

=== Pair
<sec:pair>
Compared to the huge section on arrays, this section on pairs will be
brief. #strong[`Pair` is a data structure that holds two objects] (which
typically belong to each other). We construct a pair in Julia using the
following syntax:

```language-julia
my_pair = "Julia" => 42
```

```output
"Julia" => 42
```

The elements are stored in the fields `first` and `second`.

```language-julia
my_pair.first
```

```output

Julia
```

```language-julia
my_pair.second
```

```output

42
```

But, in most cases, it’s easier use `first` and `last`#footnote[it is
easier because `first` and `last` also work on many other collections,
so you need to remember less.];:

```language-julia
first(my_pair)
```

```output

Julia
```

```language-julia
last(my_pair)
```

```output

42
```

Pairs will be used a lot in data manipulation and data visualization
since both `DataFrames.jl` (Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];) or
`Makie.jl` (Section~#link(<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>)[6];) take
objects of type `Pair` in their main functions. For example, with
`DataFrames.jl` we’re going to see that `:a => :b` can be used to rename
the column `:a` to `:b`.

=== Dict
<sec:dict>
If you understood what a `Pair` is, then `Dict` won’t be a problem. For
all practical purposes, #strong[`Dict`s are mappings from keys to
values];. By mapping, we mean that if you give a `Dict` some key, then
the `Dict` can tell you which value belongs to that key. `key`s and
`value`s can be of any type, but usually `key`s are strings.

There are two ways to construct `Dict`s in Julia. The first is by
passing a vector of tuples as `(key, value)` to the `Dict` constructor:

```language-julia
name2number_map = Dict([("one", 1), ("two", 2)])
```

```output
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "two" => 2
  "one" => 1
```

There is a more readable syntax based on the `Pair` type described
above. You can also pass `Pair`s of `key => value`s to the `Dict`
constructor:

```language-julia
name2number_map = Dict("one" => 1, "two" => 2)
```

```output
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "two" => 2
  "one" => 1
```

You can retrieve a `Dict`’s `value` by indexing it by the corresponding
`key`:

```language-julia
name2number_map["one"]
```

```output

1
```

To add a new entry, you index the `Dict` by the desired `key` and assign
a `value` with the assignment `=` operator:

```language-julia
name2number_map["three"] = 3
```

```output

3
```

If you want to check if a `Dict` has a certain `key` you can use `keys`
and `in`:

```language-julia
"two" in keys(name2number_map)
```

```output

true
```

To delete a `key` you can use either the `delete!` function:

```language-julia
delete!(name2number_map, "three")
```

```output
Dict{String, Int64} with 2 entries:
  "two" => 2
  "one" => 1
```

Or, to delete a key while returning its value, you can use `pop!`:

```language-julia
popped_value = pop!(name2number_map, "two")
```

```output

2
```

Now, our `name2number_map` has only one `key`:

```language-julia
name2number_map
```

```output
Dict{String, Int64} with 1 entry:
  "one" => 1
```

`Dict`s are also used for data manipulation by `DataFrames.jl`
(Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];) and for data visualization by
`Makie.jl` (Section~#link(<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>)[6];). So, it is
important to know their basic functionality.

There is another useful way of constructing `Dict`s. Suppose that you
have two vectors and you want to construct a `Dict` with one of them as
`key`s and the other as `value`s. You can do that with the `zip`
function which "glues" together two objects (just like a zipper):

```language-julia
A = ["one", "two", "three"]
B = [1, 2, 3]

name2number_map = Dict(zip(A, B))
```

```output
Dict{String, Int64} with 3 entries:
  "two" => 2
  "one" => 1
  "three" => 3
```

For instance, we can now get the number 3 via:

```language-julia
name2number_map["three"]
```

```output

3
```

=== Symbol
<sec:symbol>
`Symbol` is actually #emph[not] a data structure. It is a type and
behaves a lot like a string. Instead of surrounding the text by
quotation marks, a symbol starts with a colon (:) and can contain
underscores:

```language-julia
sym = :some_text
```

```output
:some_text
```

We can easily convert a symbol to string and vice versa:

```language-julia
s = string(sym)
```

```output

some_text
```

```language-julia
sym = Symbol(s)
```

```output
:some_text
```

One simple benefit of symbols is that you have to type one character
less, that is, `:some_text` versus `"some text"`. We use `Symbol`s a lot
in data manipulations with the `DataFrames.jl` package
(Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];) and data visualizations with the
`Makie.jl` package (Section~#link(<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>)[6];).

=== Splat Operator
<sec:splat>
In Julia we have the "splat" operator `...` which is used in function
calls as a #strong[sequence of arguments];. We will occasionally use
splatting in some function calls in the #strong[data manipulation] and
#strong[data visualization] chapters.

The most intuitive way to learn about splatting is with an example. The
`add_elements` function below takes three arguments to be added
together:

```language-julia
add_elements(a, b, c) = a + b + c
```

```output
add_elements (generic function with 1 method)
```

Now, suppose that we have a collection with three elements. The naïve
way to this would be to supply the function with all three elements as
function arguments like this:

```language-julia
my_collection = [1, 2, 3]

add_elements(my_collection[1], my_collection[2], my_collection[3])
```

```output

6
```

Here is where we use the "splat" operator `...` which takes a collection
(often an array, vector, tuple, or range) and converts it into a
sequence of arguments:

```language-julia
add_elements(my_collection...)
```

```output

6
```

The `...` is included after the collection that we want to "splat" into
a sequence of arguments. In the example above, the following are the
same:

```language-julia
add_elements(my_collection...) == add_elements(my_collection[1], my_collection[2], my_collection[3])
```

```output

true
```

Anytime Julia sees a splatting operator inside a function call, it will
be converted on a sequence of arguments for all elements of the
collection separated by commas.

It also works for ranges:

```language-julia
add_elements(1:3...)
```

```output

6
```

== Filesystem
<sec:filesystem>
In data science, most projects are undertaken in a collaborative effort.
We share code, data, tables, figures and so on. Behind everything, there
is the #strong[operating system (OS) filesystem];. In a perfect world,
the same program would give the #strong[same] output when running on
#strong[different] operating systems. Unfortunately, that is not always
the case. One instance of this is the difference between Windows paths,
such as `C:\Users\john`, and Linux paths, such as `/home/john`. This is
why it is important to discuss #strong[filesystem best practices];.

Julia has native filesystem capabilities that #strong[handle the
differences between operating systems];. They are located in the
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/file/")[`Filesystem`]
module from the core `Base` Julia library.

Whenever you are dealing with files such as CSV, Excel files or other
Julia scripts, make sure that your code #strong[works on different OS
filesystems];. This is easily accomplished with the `joinpath`,
`@__FILE__` and `pkgdir` functions.

If you write your code in a package, you can use `pkgdir` to get the
root directory of the package. For example, for the Julia Data Science
(JDS) package that we use to produce this book, the root directory is:

\/home/runner/work/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience

As you can see, the code to produce this book was running on a Linux
computer. If you’re using a script, you can get the location of the
script file via

```julia
root = dirname(@__FILE__)
```

The nice thing about these two commands is that they are independent of
how the user started Julia. In other words, it doesn’t matter whether
the user started the program with `julia scripts/script.jl` or
`julia script.jl`, in both cases the paths are the same.

The next step would be to include the relative path from `root` to our
desired file. Since different OS have different ways to construct
relative paths with subfolders (some use forward slashes `/` while other
might use backslashes `\`), we cannot simply concatenate the file’s
relative path with the `root` string. For that, we have the `joinpath`
function, which will join different relative paths and filenames
according to your specific OS filesystem implementation.

Suppose that you have a script named `my_script.jl` inside your
project’s directory. You can have a robust representation of the
filepath to `my_script.jl` as:

```language-julia
joinpath(root, "my_script.jl")
```

```output

/home/runner/work/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience/my_script.jl
```

`joinpath` also handles #strong[subfolders];. Let’s now imagine a common
situation where you have a folder named `data/` in your project’s
directory. Inside this folder there is a CSV file named `my_data.csv`.
You can have the same robust representation of the filepath to
`my_data.csv` as:

```language-julia
joinpath(root, "data", "my_data.csv")
```

```output

/home/runner/work/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience/data/my_data.csv
```

It’s a good habit to pick up, because it’s very likely to save problems
for you or other people later.

== Julia Standard Library
<sec:standardlibrary>
Julia has a #strong[rich standard library] that is available with
#emph[every] Julia installation. Contrary to everything that we have
seen so far, e.g.~types, data structures and filesystem; you
#strong[must load standard library modules into your environment] to use
a particular module or function.

This is done via `using` or `import`. In this book, we will load code
via `using`:

```julia
using ModuleName
```

After doing this, you can access all functions and types inside
`ModuleName`.

=== Dates
<sec:dates>
Knowing how to handle dates and timestamps is important in data science.
As we said in #emph[Why Julia?] (Section~#link(<sec:why_julia>)[2];)
section, Python’s `pandas` uses its own `datetime` type to handle dates.
The same is true in the R tidyverse’s `lubridate` package, which also
defines its own `datetime` type to handle dates. In Julia packages don’t
need to write their own dates logic, because Julia has a dates module in
its standard library called `Dates`.

To begin, let’s load the `Dates` module:

```julia
using Dates
```

==== `Date` and `DateTime` Types
<sec:dates_types>
The `Dates` standard library module has #strong[two types for working
with dates];:

+ `Date`: representing time in days and
+ `DateTime`: representing time in millisecond precision.

We can construct `Date` and `DateTime` with the default constructor
either by specifying an integer to represent year, month, day, hours and
so on:

```language-julia
Date(1987) # year
```

```output
1987-01-01
```

```language-julia
Date(1987, 9) # year, month
```

```output
1987-09-01
```

```language-julia
Date(1987, 9, 13) # year, month, day
```

```output
1987-09-13
```

```language-julia
DateTime(1987, 9, 13, 21) # year, month, day, hour
```

```output
1987-09-13T21:00:00
```

```language-julia
DateTime(1987, 9, 13, 21, 21) # year, month, day, hour, minute
```

```output
1987-09-13T21:21:00
```

For the curious, September 13th 1987, 21:21 is the official time of
birth of the first author, Jose.

We can also pass `Period` types to the default constructor.
#strong[`Period` types are the human-equivalent representation of time]
for the computer. Julia’s `Dates` have the following `Period` abstract
subtypes:

```language-julia
subtypes(Period)
```

```output
DatePeriod
```

```output
TimePeriod
```

which divide into the following concrete types, and they are pretty much
self-explanatory:

```language-julia
subtypes(DatePeriod)
```

```output
Day
```

```output
Month
```

```output
Quarter
```

```output
Week
```

```output
Year
```

```language-julia
subtypes(TimePeriod)
```

```output
Hour
```

```output
Microsecond
```

```output
Millisecond
```

```output
Minute
```

```output
Nanosecond
```

```output
Second
```

So, we could alternatively construct Jose’s official time of birth as:

```language-julia
DateTime(Year(1987), Month(9), Day(13), Hour(21), Minute(21))
```

```output
1987-09-13T21:21:00
```

==== Parsing Dates
<sec:dates_parsing>
Most of the time, we won’t be constructing `Date` or `DateTime`
instances from scratch. Actually, we will probably be #strong[parsing
strings as `Date` or `DateTime` types];.

The `Date` and `DateTime` constructors can be fed a string and a format
string. For example, the string `"19870913"` representing September 13th
1987 can be parsed with:

```language-julia
Date("19870913", "yyyymmdd")
```

```output
1987-09-13
```

Notice that the second argument is a string representation of the
format. We have the first four digits representing year `y`, followed by
two digits for month `m` and finally two digits for day `d`.

It also works for timestamps with `DateTime`:

```language-julia
DateTime("1987-09-13T21:21:00", "yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS")
```

```output
1987-09-13T21:21:00
```

You can find more on how to specify different date formats in the
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Dates/#Dates.DateFormat")[Julia `Dates`’ documentation];.
Don’t worry if you have to revisit it all the time, we ourselves do that
too when working with dates and timestamps.

According to
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Dates/#Constructors")[Julia `Dates`’ documentation];,
using the `Date(date_string, format_string)` method is fine if it’s only
called a few times. If there are many similarly formatted date strings
to parse, however, it is much more efficient to first create a
`DateFormat` type, and then pass it instead of a raw format string.
Then, our previous example becomes:

```language-julia
format = DateFormat("yyyymmdd")
Date("19870913", format)
```

```output
1987-09-13
```

Alternatively, without loss of performance, you can use the string
literal prefix `dateformat"..."`:

```language-julia
Date("19870913", dateformat"yyyymmdd")
```

```output
1987-09-13
```

==== Extracting Date Information
<sec:dates_information>
It is easy to #strong[extract desired information from `Date` and
`DateTime` objects];. First, let’s create an instance of a very special
date:

```language-julia
my_birthday = Date("1987-09-13")
```

```output
1987-09-13
```

We can extract anything we want from `my_birthday`:

```language-julia
year(my_birthday)
```

```output

1987
```

```language-julia
month(my_birthday)
```

```output

9
```

```language-julia
day(my_birthday)
```

```output

13
```

Julia’s `Dates` module also has #strong[compound functions that return a
tuple of values];:

```language-julia
yearmonth(my_birthday)
```

```output
(1987, 9)
```

```language-julia
monthday(my_birthday)
```

```output
(9, 13)
```

```language-julia
yearmonthday(my_birthday)
```

```output
(1987, 9, 13)
```

We can also see the day of the week and other handy stuff:

```language-julia
dayofweek(my_birthday)
```

```output

7
```

```language-julia
dayname(my_birthday)
```

```output

Sunday
```

```language-julia
dayofweekofmonth(my_birthday)
```

```output

2
```

Yep, Jose was born on the second Sunday of September.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Here’s a handy tip to just recover weekdays from
`Dates` instances. Just use a `filter` on `dayofweek(your_date) <= 5`.
For business day you can checkout the
#link("https://github.com/JuliaFinance/BusinessDays.jl")[`BusinessDays.jl`]
package.
]

==== Date Operations
<sec:dates_operations>
We can perform #strong[operations] in `Dates` instances. For example, we
can add days to a `Date` or `DateTime` instance. Notice that Julia’s
`Dates` will automatically perform the adjustments necessary for leap
years, and for months with 30 or 31 days (this is known as
#emph[calendrical] arithmetic).

```language-julia
my_birthday + Day(90)
```

```output
1987-12-12
```

We can add as many as we like:

```language-julia
my_birthday + Day(90) + Month(2) + Year(1)
```

```output
1989-02-11
```

In case you’re ever wondering: "What can I do with dates again? What is
available?", then you can use `methodswith` to check it out. We show
only the first 20 results here:

```language-julia
first(methodswith(Date), 20)
```

```output

[20] floor(dt::Date, p::Week) @ Dates /opt/hostedtoolcache/julia/1.11.7/x64/share/julia/stdlib/v1.11/Dates/src/rounding.jl:66
```

From this, we can conclude that we can also use the plus `+` and minus
`-` operator. Let’s see how old Jose is, in days:

```language-julia
today() - my_birthday
```

```output
13903 days
```

The #strong[default duration] of `Date` types is a `Day` instance. For
the `DateTime`, the default duration is `Millisecond` instance:

```language-julia
DateTime(today()) - DateTime(my_birthday)
```

```output
1201219200000 milliseconds
```

==== Date Intervals
<sec:dates_intervals>
One nice thing about `Dates` module is that we can also easily construct
#strong[date and time intervals];. Julia is clever enough to not have to
define the whole interval types and operations that we covered in
Section~#link(<sec:ranges>)[3.3.6];. It just extends the functions and
operations defined for range to `Date`’s types. This is known as
multiple dispatch and we already covered this in #emph[Why Julia?]
(Section~#link(<sec:why_julia>)[2];).

For example, suppose that you want to create a `Day` interval. This is
easy done with the colon `:` operator:

```language-julia
Date("2021-01-01"):Day(1):Date("2021-01-07")
```

```output
2021-01-01
```

```output
2021-01-02
```

```output
2021-01-03
```

```output
2021-01-04
```

```output
2021-01-05
```

```output
2021-01-06
```

```output
2021-01-07
```

There is nothing special in using `Day(1)` as the interval, we can
#strong[use whatever `Period` type] as interval. For example, using 3
days as the interval:

```language-julia
Date("2021-01-01"):Day(3):Date("2021-01-07")
```

```output
2021-01-01
```

```output
2021-01-04
```

```output
2021-01-07
```

Or even months:

```language-julia
Date("2021-01-01"):Month(1):Date("2021-03-01")
```

```output
2021-01-01
```

```output
2021-02-01
```

```output
2021-03-01
```

Note that the #strong[type of this interval is a `StepRange` with the
`Date` and concrete `Period` type] we used as interval inside the colon
`:` operator:

```language-julia
date_interval = Date("2021-01-01"):Month(1):Date("2021-03-01")
typeof(date_interval)
```

```output
StepRange{Date, Month}
```

We can convert this to a #strong[vector] with the `collect` function:

```language-julia
collected_date_interval = collect(date_interval)
```

```output
2021-01-01
```

```output
2021-02-01
```

```output
2021-03-01
```

And have all the #strong[array functionalities available];, like, for
example, indexing:

```language-julia
collected_date_interval[end]
```

```output
2021-03-01
```

We can also #strong[broadcast date operations] to our vector of `Date`s:

```language-julia
collected_date_interval .+ Day(10)
```

```output
2021-01-11
```

```output
2021-02-11
```

```output
2021-03-11
```

Similarly, these examples work for `DateTime` types too.

=== Random Numbers
<sec:random>
Another important module in Julia’s standard library is the `Random`
module. This module deals with #strong[random number generation];.
`Random` is a rich library and, if you’re interested, you should consult
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/")[Julia’s `Random` documentation];.
We will cover #emph[only] three functions: `rand`, `randn` and `seed!`.

To begin, we first load the `Random` module. Since we know exactly what
we want to load, we can just as well do that explicitly:

```julia
using Random: seed!
```

We have #strong[two main functions that generate random numbers];:

- `rand`: samples a #strong[random element] of a data structure or type.
- `randn`: samples a random number from a #strong[standard normal
  distribution] (mean 0 and standard deviation 1).

==== `rand`
<sec:random_rand>
By default, if you call `rand` without arguments it will return a
`Float64` in the interval $\[ 0 , 1 \)$, which means between 0 inclusive
to 1 exclusive:

```language-julia
rand()
```

```output

0.03091701287545645
```

You can modify `rand` arguments in several ways. For example, suppose
you want more than 1 random number:

```language-julia
rand(3)
```

```output
[0.19873541698291441, 0.7042048861699394, 0.2702294862838601]
```

Or, you want a different interval:

```language-julia
rand(1.0:10.0)
```

```output

4.0
```

You can also specify a different step size inside the interval and a
different type. Here we are using numbers without the dot `.` so Julia
will interpret them as `Int64` and not as `Float64`:

```language-julia
rand(2:2:20)
```

```output

4
```

You can also mix and match arguments:

```language-julia
rand(2:2:20, 3)
```

```output
[2, 2, 6]
```

It also supports a collection of elements as a tuple:

```language-julia
rand((42, "Julia", 3.14))
```

```output

Julia
```

And also arrays:

```language-julia
rand([1, 2, 3])
```

```output

3
```

`Dict`s:

```language-julia
rand(Dict(:one => 1, :two => 2))
```

```output
:two => 2
```

For all the `rand` arguments options, you can specify the desired random
number dimensions in a tuple. If you do this, the returned type will be
an array. For example, here’s a 2x2 matrix of `Float64` numbers between
1.0 and 3.0:

```language-julia
rand(1.0:3.0, (2, 2))
```

```output
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 2.0  2.0
 2.0  2.0
```

==== `randn`
<sec:random_randn>
`randn` follows the same general principle from `rand` but now it only
returns numbers generated from the #strong[standard normal
distribution];. The standard normal distribution is the normal
distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The default type is
`Float64` and it only allows for subtypes of `AbstractFloat` or
`Complex`:

```language-julia
randn()
```

```output

0.4820110853035048
```

We can only specify the size:

```language-julia
randn((2, 2))
```

```output
2×2 Matrix{Float64}:
 -0.870742  0.495615
 -0.836398  0.928398
```

==== `seed!`
<sec:random_seed>
To finish off the `Random` overview, let’s talk about
#strong[reproducibility];. Often, we want to make something
#strong[replicable];. Meaning that, we want the random number generator
to generate the #strong[same random sequence of numbers];. We can do so
with the `seed!` function:

```language-julia
seed!(123)
rand(3)
```

```output
[0.521213795535383, 0.5868067574533484, 0.8908786980927811]
```

```language-julia
seed!(123)
rand(3)
```

```output
[0.521213795535383, 0.5868067574533484, 0.8908786980927811]
```

In some cases, calling `seed!` at the beginning of your script is not
good enough. To avoid `rand` or `randn` to depend on a global variable,
we can instead define an instance of a `seed!` and pass it as a first
argument of #strong[either `rand` or `randn`];.

```language-julia
my_seed = seed!(123)
```

```output
Random.TaskLocalRNG()
```

```language-julia
rand(my_seed, 3)
```

```output
[0.521213795535383, 0.5868067574533484, 0.8908786980927811]
```

```language-julia
rand(my_seed, 3)
```

```output
[0.19090669902576285, 0.5256623915420473, 0.3905882754313441]
```

#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Note that these numbers might differ for
different Julia versions. To have stable streams across Julia versions
use the `StableRNGs.jl` package.
]

=== Downloads
<sec:downloads>
We’ll also cover the standard library’s #strong[`Downloads` module];. It
will be really brief because we will only be covering a single function
named `download`.

Suppose you want to #strong[download a file from the internet to your
local storage];. You can accomplish this with the `download` function.
The first and only required argument is the file’s url. You can also
specify as a second argument the desired output path for the downloaded
file (don’t forget the filesystem best practices!). If you don’t specify
a second argument, Julia will, by default, create a temporary file with
the `tempfile` function.

Let’s load the `Downloads` module:

```julia
using Downloads
```

For example, let’s download our
#link("https://github.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience")[`JuliaDataScience` GitHub repository]
`Project.toml` file. Note that `download` function is not exported by
`Downloads` module, so we have to use the `Module.function` syntax. By
default, it returns a string that holds the file path for the downloaded
file:

```language-julia
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JuliaDataScience/JuliaDataScience/main/Project.toml"

my_file = Downloads.download(url) # tempfile() being created
```

```output

/tmp/jl_CLy121UH0N
```

With `readlines`, we can look at the first 4 lines of our downloaded
file:

```language-julia
readlines(my_file)[1:4]
```

```output
4-element Vector{String}:
 "name = \"JDS\""
 "uuid = \"6c596d62-2771-44f8-8373-3ec4b616ee9d\""
 "authors = [\"Jose Storopoli <jose@storopoli.com>\", \"Rik Huijzer <huijzer.xyzcontact.stylishly377@passmail.net>\", \"Lazaro Alonso <lazarus.alon@gmail.com>\"]"
 ""
```

#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] For more complex HTTP interactions such as
interacting with web APIs, see the
#link("https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl")[`HTTP.jl` package];.
]

=== Project Management
<sec:project_management>
One last thing from Julia’s standard library for us to cover is the
#strong[`Pkg` module];. As described in
Section~#link(<sec:programmers>)[2.2];, Julia offers a #strong[built-in
package manager];, with dependencies and version control tightly
controlled, manageable, and replicable.

Unlike traditional package managers, which install and manage a single
global set of packages, Julia’s package manager is designed around
"environments": independent sets of packages that can be local to an
individual project or shared between projects. Each project maintains
its own independent set of package versions.

==== `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`
<sec:project_management_toml>
Inside every project environment there is a simple setup involving
#link("https://toml.io")[`.toml`] files in a folder. The folder, in this
context, can be perceived as a "project" folder. The project environment
is derived on two `.toml` files:

- #strong[`Project.toml`];: #emph[higher];-level description of the
  project environment with the top-level package list.
- #strong[`Manifest.toml`];: #emph[lower];-level description of the
  project environment with the full dependencies list and their
  versions. This file is machine-generated, which means that users are
  not encouraged to edit it.

==== Creating Project Environments
<sec:project_management_creating>
In order to create a new project environment, you can #strong[enter the
`Pkg` REPL mode by typing `]` (right-bracket) in the Julia REPL];:

```julia-repl
julia>]
```

Then it becomes the #strong[`Pkg` REPL mode];:

```julia-repl
(@v1.8) pkg>
```

Here we can see that the REPL prompts changes from `julia>` to `pkg>`.
There’s also additional information inside the parentheses regarding
which project environment is currently active, `(@v1.8)`. The `v1.8`
project environment is the default environment for your currently Julia
installation (which in our case is Julia version `1.8.X`).

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] You can see a list of available commands in the
`Pkg` REPL mode with the #strong[`help` command];.
]

Julia has separate default environments for each minor release, the `X`s
in the `1.X` Julia version. Anything that we perform in this default
environment will impact any fresh Julia session on that version. Hence,
we need to create a new environment by using the #strong[`activate`
command];:

```julia-repl
(@v1.8) pkg> activate .
  Activating project at `~/user/folder`

(folder) pkg>
```

This activates a project environment in the directory that your Julia
REPL is running. In my case this is located at `~/user/folder`. Now we
can start adding packages to our project environment with the
#strong[`add` command] in the `Pkg` REPL mode:

```julia-repl
(folder) pkg> add DataFrames
    Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General.toml`
   Resolving package versions...

```

From the `add` output, we can see that Julia automatically creates
#emph[both] the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files. In the
`Project.toml`, it adds a new package to the project environment package
list. Here are the contents of the `Project.toml`:

```toml
[deps]
DataFrames = "a93c6f00-e57d-5684-b7b6-d8193f3e46c0"
```

This is a `.toml` file where:

- `[deps]`: a TOML table (also know as #emph[hash tables] or
  #emph[dictionaries];)
- `DataFrames`: a key in the TOML `deps` table; this is the name of the
  package
- `"a93c6f00-e57d-5684-b7b6-d8193f3e46c0"`: the value for the
  `DataFrames` key; this is the
  #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier")[universally unique identifier (UUID)]
  of the package.

Let’s also take a peek into the `Manifest.toml`. Here we will truncate
the output since it is a big machine-generated file:

```toml
# This file is machine-generated - editing it directly is not advised

julia_version = "1.8.3"
manifest_format = "2.0"
project_hash = "376d427149ea94494cc22001edd58d53c9b2bee1"

The three dots above (`...`) represents truncated output. First, the
`Manifest.toml` presents us a comment saying that it is
machine-generated and discouragin editing it directly. Then, there are
entries for the Julia version (`julia_version`), `Manifest.toml` format
version (`manifest_format`), and project environment hash
(`project_hash`). Finally, it proceeds with a TOML array of tables which
are the double brackets entries (`[[...]]`). These entries stands for
the dependencies of all packages necessary to create the environment
described in the `Project.toml`. Therefore all of the `DataFrames.jl`'s
dependencies and its dependencies' dependencies (and so on…) are listed
here with their name, UUID, and version.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Julia’s standard library module do not have a
`version` key in the `Manifest.toml` because they are already specified
by the Julia version (`julia_version`). This is the case for the
`Artifacts` entry in the truncated `Manifest.toml` output above, since
it is a module in Julia’s standard library.

We can keep adding as many packages as we like with the `add` command.
To remove a package you can use the #strong[`rm` command] in the `Pkg`
REPL mode:

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Julia’s `Pkg` REPL mode supports autocompletion
with `<TAB>`. You can, for example, in the above command start typing
`rm DataF<TAB>` and it will autocomplete to `rm DataFrames`.
]

We can see that `rm DataFrames` undoes `add DataFrame` by removing
entries in #emph[both] `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml`.

==== Sharing Project Environments
<sec:project_management_sharing>
Once you have a project environment with #emph[both] the `Project.toml`
and `Manifest.toml` files, you can #strong[share] it with any user to
have a #strong[perfectly reproducible project environment];.

Now let’s cover the other end of the process. Suppose you received a
`Project.toml` and a `Manifest.toml` from someone.

How would you proceed to #strong[instantiate a Julia project
environment];?

It is a simple process:

+ Put the `Project.toml` and a `Manifest.toml` files into a folder.
+ Open a Julia REPL in that folder and activate it as a project
  environment with `]activate`.
+ Instantiate the environment with the `]instantiate` command.

That’s it! Once the project environment finished downloading and
instantiating the dependencies listed in the `Project.toml` and
`Manifest.toml` files, you’ll have an exact copy of the project
environment sent to you.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] You can also add `[compat]` bounds in the
`Project.toml` to specify which package versions your project
environment is compatible with. This is an advanced-user functionality
which we will not cover. Take a look at the
#link("https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/compatibility/")[`Pkg.jl` standard library module documentation on compatibility];.
For people new to Julia, we recommend sharing #emph[both] `Project.toml`
and `Manifest.toml` for a fully reproducible environment.
]

= DataFrames.jl
<sec:dataframes>
Data comes mostly in a tabular format. By tabular, we mean that the data
consists of a table containing rows and columns. Entries within any one
column are usually of the same data type, whereas entries within a given
row typically have different types. The rows, in practice, denote
observations while columns denote variables. For example, we can have a
table of TV shows containing the country in which each was produced and
our personal rating, see Table~#link(<tbl:TV_shows>)[1];.

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [country], [rating],),
    table.hline(),
    [Game of Thrones], [United States], [8.2],
    [The Crown], [England], [7.3],
    [Friends], [United States], [7.8],
    […], […], […],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 1: TV shows.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:TV_shows>
Here, the dots mean that this could be a very long table and we only
show a few rows. While analyzing data, often we come up with interesting
questions about the data, also known as #emph[data queries];. For large
tables, computers would be able to answer these kinds of questions much
quicker than you could do it by hand. Some examples of these so-called
#emph[queries] for this data could be:

- Which TV show has the highest rating?
- Which TV shows were produced in the United States?
- Which TV shows were produced in the same country?

But, as a researcher, real science often starts with having multiple
tables or data sources. For example, if we also have data from someone
else’s ratings for the TV shows (Table~#link(<tbl:ratings>)[2];):

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [rating],),
    table.hline(),
    [Game of Thrones], [7],
    [Friends], [6.4],
    […], […],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 2: Ratings.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:ratings>
Now, questions that we could ask ourselves could be:

- What is Game of Thrones’ average rating?
- Who gave the highest rating for Friends?
- What TV shows were rated by you but not by the other person?

In the rest of this chapter, we will show you how you can easily answer
these questions in Julia. To do so, we first show why we need a Julia
package called `DataFrames.jl`. In the next sections, we show how you
can use this package and, finally, we show how to write fast data
transformations (Section~#link(<sec:df_performance>)[4.10];).

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] `DataFrames.jl` has some
#link("https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2021/05/14/nrow.html")[guiding principles];.
Notably, we would like to highlight two of them:

+ Stay #strong[consistent with Julia’s `Base`] module functions.
+ #strong[Minimize the number of functions] `DataFrames.jl` provides.

Those two principles are really powerful because if you have a good
grasp of Julia’s basic functions, such as `filter`, then you can do
powerful operations on tabular data.

This is a benefit over Python’s `pandas` or R’s `dplyr` which differ
more from the core languages.
]

Let’s look at a table of grades like the one in
Table~#link(<tbl:grades_for_2020>)[3];:

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Bob], [17], [5.0],
    [Sally], [18], [1.0],
    [Alice], [20], [8.5],
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 3: Grades for 2020.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:grades_for_2020>
Here, the column name has type `string`, age has type `integer`, and
grade has type `float`.

So far, this book has only handled Julia’s basics. These basics are
great for many things, but not for tables. To show that we need more,
lets try to store the tabular data in arrays:

```language-julia
function grades_array()
    name = ["Bob", "Sally", "Alice", "Hank"]
    age = [17, 18, 20, 19]
    grade_2020 = [5.0, 1.0, 8.5, 4.0]
    (; name, age, grade_2020)
end
```

Now, the data is stored in so-called column-major form, which is
cumbersome when we want to get data from a row:

```language-julia
function second_row()
    name, age, grade_2020 = grades_array()
    i = 2
    row = (name[i], age[i], grade_2020[i])
end
JDS.second_row()
```

```output
("Sally", 18, 1.0)
```

Or, if you want to have the grade for Alice, you first need to figure
out in what row Alice is:

```language-julia
function row_alice()
    names = grades_array().name
    i = findfirst(names .== "Alice")
end
row_alice()
```

```output

3
```

and then we can get the value:

```language-julia
function value_alice()
    grades = grades_array().grade_2020
    i = row_alice()
    grades[i]
end
value_alice()
```

```output

8.5
```

`DataFrames.jl` can easily solve these kinds of issues. You can start by
loading `DataFrames.jl` with `using`:

```
using DataFrames
```

With `DataFrames.jl`, we can define a `DataFrame` to hold our tabular
data:

```language-julia
names = ["Sally", "Bob", "Alice", "Hank"]
grades = [1, 5, 8.5, 4]
df = DataFrame(; name=names, grade_2020=grades)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

which gives us a variable `df` containing our data in table format.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] This works, but there is one thing that we need
to change straight away. In this example, we defined the variables
`name`, `grade_2020` and `df` in global scope. This means that these
variables can be accessed and edited from anywhere. If we would continue
writing the book like this, we would have a few hundred variables at the
end of the book even though the data that we put into the variable
`name` should only be accessed via `DataFrame`! The variables `name` and
`grade_2020` were never meant to be kept for long! Now, imagine that we
would change the contents of `grade_2020` a few times in this book.
Given only the book as PDF, it would be near impossible to figure out
the contents of the variable by the end.

We can solve this very easily by using functions.
]

Let’s do the same thing as before but now in a function:

```language-julia
function grades_2020()
    name = ["Sally", "Bob", "Alice", "Hank"]
    grade_2020 = [1, 5, 8.5, 4]
    DataFrame(; name, grade_2020)
end
grades_2020()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 4: Grades 2020.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:grades_2020>
Note that `name` and `grade_2020` are destroyed after the function
returns, that is, they are only available in the function. There are two
other benefits of doing this. First, it is now clear to the reader where
`name` and `grade_2020` belong to: they belong to the grades of 2020.
Second, it is easy to determine what the output of `grades_2020()` would
be at any point in the book. For example, we can now assign the data to
a variable `df`:

```language-julia
df = grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Change the contents of `df`:

```language-julia
df = DataFrame(name = ["Malice"], grade_2020 = ["10"])
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Malice], [10],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

And still recover the original data back without any problem:

```language-julia
df = grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Of course, this assumes that the function is not re-defined. We promise
to not do that in this book, because it is a bad idea exactly for this
reason. Instead of "changing" a function, we will make a new one and
give it a clear name.

So, back to the `DataFrames` constructor. As you might have seen, the
way to create one is simply to pass vectors as arguments into the
`DataFrame` constructor. You can come up with any valid Julia vector and
it will work #strong[as long as the vectors have the same length];.
Duplicates, Unicode symbols and any sort of numbers are fine:

```language-julia
DataFrame(σ = ["a", "a", "a"], δ = [π, π/2, π/3])
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([σ], [δ],),
    table.hline(),
    [a], [3.141592653589793],
    [a], [1.5707963267948966],
    [a], [1.0471975511965976],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Typically, in your code, you would create a function which wraps around
one or more `DataFrame`s’ functions. For example, we can make a function
to get the grades for one or more `names`:

```language-julia
function grades_2020(names::Vector{Int})
    df = grades_2020()
    df[names, :]
end
JDS.grades_2020([3, 4])
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

This way of using functions to wrap around basic functionality in
programming languages and packages is quite common. Basically, you can
think of Julia and `DataFrames.jl` as providers of building blocks. They
provide very #strong[generic] building blocks which allow you to build
things for your #strong[specific] use case like this grades example. By
using the blocks, you can make a data analysis script, control a robot
or whatever you like to build.

So far, the examples were quite cumbersome, because we had to use
indexes. In the next sections, we will show how to load and save data,
and many powerful building blocks provided by `DataFrames.jl`.

== Load and Save Files
<sec:load_save>
Having only data inside Julia programs and not being able to load or
save it would be very limiting. Therefore, we start by mentioning how to
store files to and load files from disk. We focus on CSV, see
Section~#link(<sec:csv>)[4.1.1];, and Excel, see
Section~#link(<sec:excel>)[4.1.2];, file formats since those are the
most common data storage formats for tabular data.

=== CSV
<sec:csv>
#strong[C];omma-#strong[s];eparated #strong[v];alues (CSV) files are are
very effective way to store tables. CSV files have two advantages over
other data storage files. First, it does exactly what the name indicates
it does, namely storing values by separating them using commas `,`. This
acronym is also used as the file extension. So, be sure that you save
your files using the ".csv" extension such as "myfile.csv". To
demonstrate how a CSV file looks, we can add the
#link("http://csv.juliadata.org/latest/")[`CSV.jl`] package using the
`Pkg` REPL mode
(Section~#link(<sec:project_management_creating>)[3.5.4.2];):

```julia-repl
julia> ]

pkg> add CSV
```

and load it via:

```julia
using CSV
```

We can now use our previous data:

```language-julia
grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

and read it from a file after writing it:

```language-julia
function write_grades_csv()
    path = "grades.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_2020())
end
```

```language-julia
path = write_grades_csv()
read(path, String)
```

```output
name,grade_2020
Sally,1.0
Bob,5.0
Alice,8.5
Hank,4.0
```

Here, we also see the second benefit of CSV data format: the data can be
read by using a simple text editor. This differs from many alternative
data formats which require proprietary software, e.g.~Excel.

This works wonders, but what if our data #strong[contains commas `,`] as
values? If we were to naively write data with commas, it would make the
files very hard to convert back to a table. Luckily, `CSV.jl` handles
this for us automatically. Consider the following data with commas `,`:

```language-julia
function grades_with_commas()
    df = grades_2020()
    df[3, :name] = "Alice,"
    df
end
grades_with_commas()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice,], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 5: Grades with commas.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:grades_with_commas>
If we write this, we get:

```language-julia
function write_comma_csv()
    path = "grades-commas.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_with_commas())
end
path = write_comma_csv()
read(path, String)
```

```output
name,grade_2020
Sally,1.0
Bob,5.0
"Alice,",8.5
Hank,4.0
```

So, `CSV.jl` adds quotation marks `"` around the comma-containing
values. Another common way to solve this problem is to write the data to
a #strong[t];ab-#strong[s];eparated #strong[v];alues (TSV) file format.
This assumes that the data doesn’t contain tabs, which holds in most
cases.

Also, note that TSV files can also be read using a simple text editor,
and these files use the ".tsv" extension.

```language-julia
function write_comma_tsv()
    path = "grades-comma.tsv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_with_commas(); delim='\t')
end
read(write_comma_tsv(), String)
```

```output
name    grade_2020
Sally   1.0
Bob 5.0
Alice,  8.5
Hank    4.0
```

Text file formats like CSV and TSV files can also be found that use
other delimiters, such as semicolons ";", spaces "~", or even something
as unusual as "π".

```language-julia
function write_space_separated()
    path = "grades-space-separated.csv"
    CSV.write(path, grades_2020(); delim=' ')
end
read(write_space_separated(), String)
```

```output
name grade_2020
Sally 1.0
Bob 5.0
Alice 8.5
Hank 4.0
```

By convention, it’s still best to give files with special delimiters,
such as ";", the ".csv" extension.

Loading CSV files using `CSV.jl` is done in a similar way. You can use
`CSV.read` and specify in what kind of format you want the output. We
specify a `DataFrame`.

```language-julia
path = write_grades_csv()
CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Conveniently, `CSV.jl` will automatically infer column types for us:

```language-julia
path = write_grades_csv()
df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
```

```output
4×2 DataFrame
 Row │ name     grade_2020
     │ String7  Float64
─────┼─────────────────────
   1 │ Sally           1.0
   2 │ Bob             5.0
   3 │ Alice           8.5
   4 │ Hank            4.0
```

It works even for far more complex data:

```language-julia
my_data = """
    a,b,c,d,e
    Kim,2018-02-03,3,4.0,2018-02-03T10:00
    """
path = "my_data.csv"
write(path, my_data)
df = CSV.read(path, DataFrame)
```

```output
1×5 DataFrame
 Row │ a        b           c      d        e
     │ String3  Date        Int64  Float64  DateTime
─────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1 │ Kim      2018-02-03      3      4.0  2018-02-03T10:00:00
```

These CSV basics should cover most use cases. For more information, see
the #link("https://csv.juliadata.org/stable")[`CSV.jl` documentation]
and especially the
#link("https://csv.juliadata.org/stable/#CSV.File")[`CSV.File` constructor docstring];.

=== Excel
<sec:excel>
There are multiple Julia packages to read Excel files. In this book, we
will only look at
#link("https://github.com/felipenoris/XLSX.jl")[`XLSX.jl`];, because it
is the most actively maintained package in the Julia ecosystem that
deals with Excel data. As a second benefit, `XLSX.jl` is written in pure
Julia, which makes it easy for us to inspect and understand what’s going
on under the hood.

Load `XLSX.jl` via

```
using XLSX:
    eachtablerow,
    readxlsx,
    writetable
```

To write files, we define a little helper function for data and column
names:

```language-julia
function write_xlsx(name, df::DataFrame)
    path = "$name.xlsx"
    data = collect(eachcol(df))
    cols = names(df)
    writetable(path, data, cols)
end
```

Now, we can easily write the grades to an Excel file:

```language-julia
function write_grades_xlsx()
    path = "grades"
    write_xlsx(path, grades_2020())
    "$path.xlsx"
end
```

When reading it back, we will see that `XLSX.jl` puts the data in a
`XLSXFile` type and we can access the desired `sheet` much like a
`Dict`:

```language-julia
path = write_grades_xlsx()
xf = readxlsx(path)
```

```output
XLSXFile("grades.xlsx") containing 1 Worksheet
            sheetname size          range        
-------------------------------------------------
               Sheet1 5x2           A1:B5        
```

```language-julia
xf = readxlsx(write_grades_xlsx())
sheet = xf["Sheet1"]
eachtablerow(sheet) |> DataFrame
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Notice that we cover just the basics of `XLSX.jl` but more powerful
usage and customizations are available. For more information and
options, see the
#link("https://felipenoris.github.io/XLSX.jl/stable/")[`XLSX.jl` documentation];.

== Index and Summarize
<index-and-summarize>
Let’s go back to the example `grades_2020()` data defined before:

```language-julia
grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

To retrieve a #strong[vector] for `name`, we can access the `DataFrame`
with the `.`, as we did previously with `struct`s in
Section~#link(<sec:julia_basics>)[3];:

```language-julia
function names_grades1()
    df = grades_2020()
    df.name
end
JDS.names_grades1()
```

```output
["Sally", "Bob", "Alice", "Hank"]
```

or we can index a `DataFrame` much like an `Array` with symbols and
special characters. The #strong[second index is the column indexing];:

```language-julia
function names_grades2()
    df = grades_2020()
    df[!, :name]
end
JDS.names_grades2()
```

```output
["Sally", "Bob", "Alice", "Hank"]
```

Note that `df.name` is exactly the same as `df[!, :name]`, which you can
verify yourself by doing:

```
julia> df = DataFrame(id=[1]);

julia> @edit df.name
```

In both cases, it gives you the column `:name`. There also exists
`df[:, :name]` which copies the column `:name`. In most cases,
`df[!, :name]` is the best bet since it is more versatile and does an
in-place modification.

For any #strong[row];, say the second row, we can use the #strong[first
index as row indexing];:

```language-julia
df = grades_2020()
df[2, :]
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Bob], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

or create a function to give us any row `i` we want:

```language-julia
function grade_2020(i::Int)
    df = grades_2020()
    df[i, :]
end
JDS.grade_2020(2)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Bob], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can also get only `names` for the first 2 rows using #strong[slicing]
(again similar to an `Array`):

```language-julia
grades_indexing(df) = df[1:2, :name]
JDS.grades_indexing(grades_2020())
```

```output
["Sally", "Bob"]
```

If we assume that all names in the table are unique, we can also write a
function to obtain the grade for a person via their `name`. To do so, we
convert the table back to one of Julia’s basic data structures (see
Section~#link(<sec:data_structures>)[3.3];) which is capable of creating
mappings, namely `Dict`s:

```language-julia
function grade_2020(name::String)
    df = grades_2020()
    dic = Dict(zip(df.name, df.grade_2020))
    dic[name]
end
grade_2020("Bob")
```

```output

5.0
```

which works because `zip` loops through `df.name` and `df.grade_2020` at
the same time like a "zipper":

```language-julia
df = grades_2020()
collect(zip(df.name, df.grade_2020))
```

```output
("Sally", 1.0)
```

```output
("Bob", 5.0)
```

```output
("Alice", 8.5)
```

```output
("Hank", 4.0)
```

However, converting a `DataFrame` to a `Dict` is only useful when the
elements are unique. Generally that is not the case and that’s why we
need to learn how to `filter` a `DataFrame`.

== Filter and Subset
<sec:filter_subset>
There are two ways to remove rows from a `DataFrame`, one is `filter`
(Section~#link(<sec:filter>)[4.3.1];) and the other is `subset`
(Section~#link(<sec:subset>)[4.3.2];). `filter` was added earlier to
`DataFrames.jl`, is more powerful and more consistent with syntax from
Julia base, so that is why we start discussing `filter` first. `subset`
is newer and often more convenient.

=== Filter
<sec:filter>
From this point on, we start to get into the more powerful features of
`DataFrames.jl`. To do this, we need to learn some functions, such as
`select` and `filter`. But don’t worry! It might be a relief to know
that the #strong[general design goal of `DataFrames.jl` is to keep the
number of functions that a user has to learn to a
minimum#footnote[According to Bogumił Kamiński (lead developer and
maintainer of `DataFrames.jl`) on Discourse
(#link("https://discourse.julialang.org/t/pull-dataframes-columns-to-the-front/60327/5");).];];.

Like before, we resume from the `grades_2020`:

```language-julia
grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can filter rows by using `filter(source => f::Function, df)`. Note
how this function is very similar to the function
`filter(f::Function, V::Vector)` from Julia `Base` module. This is
because `DataFrames.jl` uses #strong[multiple dispatch] (see
Section~#link(<sec:multiple_dispatch>)[2.3.3];) to define a new method
of `filter` that accepts a `DataFrame` as argument.

At first sight, defining and working with a function `f` for filtering
can be a bit difficult to use in practice. Hold tight, that effort is
well-paid, since #strong[it is a very powerful way of filtering data];.
As a simple example, we can create a function `equals_alice` that checks
whether its input equals "Alice":

```language-julia
equals_alice(name::String) = name == "Alice"
JDS.equals_alice("Bob")
```

```output

false
```

```language-julia
equals_alice("Alice")
```

```output

true
```

Equipped with such a function, we can use it as our function `f` to
filter out all the rows for which `name` equals "Alice":

```language-julia
filter(:name => equals_alice, grades_2020())
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Note that this doesn’t only work for `DataFrame`s, but also for vectors:

```language-julia
filter(equals_alice, ["Alice", "Bob", "Dave"])
```

```output
["Alice"]
```

We can make it a bit less verbose by using an #strong[anonymous
function] (see Section~#link(<sec:function_anonymous>)[3.2.4.4];):

```language-julia
filter(n -> n == "Alice", ["Alice", "Bob", "Dave"])
```

```output
["Alice"]
```

which we can also use on `grades_2020`:

```language-julia
filter(:name => n -> n == "Alice", grades_2020())
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

To recap, this function call can be read as "for each element in the
column `:name`, let’s call the element `n`, check whether `n` equals
Alice". For some people, this is still too verbose. Luckily, Julia has
added a #emph[partial function application] of `==`. The details are not
important – just know that you can use it just like any other function:

```language-julia
filter(:name => ==("Alice"), grades_2020())
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

To get all the rows which are #emph[not] Alice, `==` (equality) can be
replaced by `!=` (inequality) in all previous examples:

```language-julia
filter(:name => !=("Alice"), grades_2020())
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Now, to show #strong[why functions are so powerful];, we can come up
with a slightly more complex filter. In this filter, we want to have the
people whose names start with A or B #strong[and] have a grade above 6:

```language-julia
function complex_filter(name, grade)::Bool
    interesting_name = startswith(name, 'A') || startswith(name, 'B')
    interesting_grade = 6 < grade
    interesting_name && interesting_grade
end
```

```language-julia
filter([:name, :grade_2020] => complex_filter, grades_2020())
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

=== Subset
<sec:subset>
The `subset` function was added to make it easier to work with missing
values (Section~#link(<sec:missing>)[4.9];). In contrast to `filter`,
`subset` works on complete columns instead of rows or single values. If
we want to use our earlier defined functions, we should wrap it inside
`ByRow`:

```language-julia
subset(grades_2020(), :name => ByRow(equals_alice))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Also note that the `DataFrame` is now the first argument
`subset(df, args...)`, whereas in `filter` it was the second one
`filter(f, df)`. The reason for this is that Julia defines filter as
`filter(f, V::Vector)` and `DataFrames.jl` chose to maintain consistency
with existing Julia functions that were extended to `DataFrame`s types
by multiple dispatch.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Most of native `DataFrames.jl` functions, which
`subset` belongs to, have a #strong[consistent function signature that
always takes a `DataFrame` as first argument];.
]

Just like with `filter`, we can also use anonymous functions inside
`subset`:

```language-julia
subset(grades_2020(), :name => ByRow(name -> name == "Alice"))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Or, the partial function application for `==`:

```language-julia
subset(grades_2020(), :name => ByRow(==("Alice")))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Ultimately, let’s show the real power of `subset`. First, we create a
dataset with some missing values:

```language-julia
function salaries()
    names = ["John", "Hank", "Karen", "Zed"]
    salary = [1_900, 2_800, 2_800, missing]
    DataFrame(; names, salary)
end
salaries()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([names], [salary],),
    table.hline(),
    [John], [1900],
    [Hank], [2800],
    [Karen], [2800],
    [Zed], [missing],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 6: Salaries.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:salaries>
This data is about a plausible situation where you want to figure out
your colleagues’ salaries, and haven’t figured it out for Zed yet. Even
though we don’t want to encourage these practices, we suspect it is an
interesting example. Suppose we want to know who earns more than 2000.
If we use `filter`, without taking the `missing` values into account, it
will fail:

```language-julia
filter(:salary => >(2_000), salaries())
```

```output
TypeError: non-boolean (Missing) used in boolean context
Stacktrace:
  ...
```

`subset` will also fail, but it will fortunately point us towards an
easy solution:

```language-julia
subset(salaries(), :salary => ByRow(>(2_000)))
```

```output
ArgumentError: missing was returned in condition number 1 but only true or false are allowed; pass skipmissing=true to skip missing values
Stacktrace:
  ...
```

So, we just need to pass the keyword argument `skipmissing=true`:

```language-julia
subset(salaries(), :salary => ByRow(>(2_000)); skipmissing=true)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([names], [salary],),
    table.hline(),
    [Hank], [2800],
    [Karen], [2800],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Select
<sec:select>
Whereas #strong[`filter` removes rows];, #strong[`select` removes
columns];. However, `select` is much more versatile than just removing
columns, as we will discuss in this section. First, let’s create a
dataset with multiple columns:

```language-julia
function responses()
    id = [1, 2]
    q1 = [28, 61]
    q2 = [:us, :fr]
    q3 = ["F", "B"]
    q4 = ["B", "C"]
    q5 = ["A", "E"]
    DataFrame(; id, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5)
end
responses()
```

#block[
#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 6,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1], [q2], [q3], [q4], [q5],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us], [F], [B], [A],
    [2], [61], [fr], [B], [C], [E],
  )]
  , caption: [Table 7: Responses.]
  , kind: table
  )

] <tbl:responses>
Here, the data represents answers for five questions (`q1`, `q2`, …,
`q5`) in a given questionnaire. We will start by "selecting" a few
columns from this dataset. As usual, we use #strong[symbols] to specify
columns:

```language-julia
select(responses(), :id, :q1)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28],
    [2], [61],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can also use #strong[strings] if we want:

```language-julia
select(responses(), "id", "q1", "q2")
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1], [q2],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us],
    [2], [61], [fr],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Additionally, we can use #strong[Regular Expressions] with
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/#man-regex-literals")[Julia’s regex string literal];.
A string literal in Julia is a prefix that you use while constructing a
`String`. For example, the regex string literal can be created with
`r"..."` where `...` is the Regular Expression. For example, suppose you
only want to select the columns that start with `q`:

```language-julia
select(responses(), r"^q")
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 5,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([q1], [q2], [q3], [q4], [q5],),
    table.hline(),
    [28], [us], [F], [B], [A],
    [61], [fr], [B], [C], [E],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] We won’t cover regular expressions in this book,
but you are encouraged to learn about them. To build and test regular
expressions interactively, we advice to use online tools for them such
as #link("https://regex101.com/");.
]

To select #strong[everything #emph[except] one or more columns];, use
#strong[`Not`] with either a single column:

```language-julia
select(responses(), Not(:q5))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 5,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1], [q2], [q3], [q4],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us], [F], [B],
    [2], [61], [fr], [B], [C],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Or, with multiple columns:

```language-julia
select(responses(), Not([:q4, :q5]))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 4,
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1], [q2], [q3],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us], [F],
    [2], [61], [fr], [B],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

It’s also fine to mix and match columns that we want to preserve with
columns that we do `Not` want to select:

```language-julia
select(responses(), :q5, Not(:q5))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 6,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([q5], [id], [q1], [q2], [q3], [q4],),
    table.hline(),
    [A], [1], [28], [us], [F], [B],
    [E], [2], [61], [fr], [B], [C],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Note how `q5` is now the first column in the `DataFrame` returned by
`select`. There is a more clever way to achieve the same using `:`. The
colon `:` can be thought of as "all the columns that we didn’t include
yet". For example:

```language-julia
select(responses(), :q5, :)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 6,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([q5], [id], [q1], [q2], [q3], [q4],),
    table.hline(),
    [A], [1], [28], [us], [F], [B],
    [E], [2], [61], [fr], [B], [C],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Or, to put `q5` at the second position#footnote[thanks to Sudete on
Discourse
(#link("https://discourse.julialang.org/t/pull-dataframes-columns-to-the-front/60327/4");)
for this suggestion.];:

```language-julia
select(responses(), 1, :q5, :)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 6,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q5], [q1], [q2], [q3], [q4],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [A], [28], [us], [F], [B],
    [2], [E], [61], [fr], [B], [C],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] As you might have observed there are several ways
to select a column. These are known as
#link("https://bkamins.github.io/julialang/2021/02/06/colsel.html")[#emph[column selectors];];.

We can use:

- #strong[`Symbol`];: `select(df, :col)`
- #strong[`String`];: `select(df, "col")`
- #strong[`Integer`];: `select(df, 1)`
- #strong[`RegEx`];: `select(df, r"RegEx")`
]

Even renaming columns is possible via `select` using the
#strong[`source => target`] pair syntax:

```language-julia
select(responses(), 1 => "participant", :q1 => "age", :q2 => "nationality")
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([participant], [age], [nationality],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us],
    [2], [61], [fr],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Additionally, thanks to the "splat" operator `...` (see
Section~#link(<sec:splat>)[3.3.11];), we can also write:

```language-julia
renames = (1 => "participant", :q1 => "age", :q2 => "nationality")
select(responses(), renames...)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([participant], [age], [nationality],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us],
    [2], [61], [fr],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Types and Categorical Data
<sec:types>
As discussed in Section~#link(<sec:load_save>)[4.1];, `CSV.jl` will do
its best to guess what kind of types your data have as columns. However,
this won’t always work perfectly. In this section, we show why suitable
types are important and we fix wrong data types. To be more clear about
the types, we show the text output for `DataFrame`s instead of a
pretty-formatted table. In this section, we work with the following
dataset:

```language-julia
function wrong_types()
    id = 1:4
    date = ["28-01-2018", "03-04-2019", "01-08-2018", "22-11-2020"]
    age = ["adolescent", "adult", "infant", "adult"]
    DataFrame(; id, date, age)
end
wrong_types()
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  String      String
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     1  28-01-2018  adolescent
   2 │     2  03-04-2019  adult
   3 │     3  01-08-2018  infant
   4 │     4  22-11-2020  adult
```

Because the date column has the wrong type, sorting won’t work
correctly:

```language-julia
sort(wrong_types(), :date)
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  String      String
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     3  01-08-2018  infant
   2 │     2  03-04-2019  adult
   3 │     4  22-11-2020  adult
   4 │     1  28-01-2018  adolescent
```

To fix the sorting, we can use the `Date` module from Julia’s standard
library as described in Section~#link(<sec:dates>)[3.5.1];:

```language-julia
function fix_date_column(df::DataFrame)
    strings2dates(dates::Vector) = Date.(dates, dateformat"dd-mm-yyyy")
    dates = strings2dates(df[!, :date])
    df[!, :date] = dates
    df
end
fix_date_column(wrong_types())
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  Date        String
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     1  2018-01-28  adolescent
   2 │     2  2019-04-03  adult
   3 │     3  2018-08-01  infant
   4 │     4  2020-11-22  adult
```

Now, sorting will work as intended:

```language-julia
df = fix_date_column(wrong_types())
sort(df, :date)
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  Date        String
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     1  2018-01-28  adolescent
   2 │     3  2018-08-01  infant
   3 │     2  2019-04-03  adult
   4 │     4  2020-11-22  adult
```

For the age column, we have a similar problem:

```language-julia
sort(wrong_types(), :age)
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  String      String
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     1  28-01-2018  adolescent
   2 │     2  03-04-2019  adult
   3 │     4  22-11-2020  adult
   4 │     3  01-08-2018  infant
```

This isn’t right, because an infant is younger than adults and
adolescents. The solution for this issue and any sort of categorical
data is to use `CategoricalArrays.jl`:

=== CategoricalArrays.jl
<sec:categoricalarrays>
```
using CategoricalArrays
```

With the `CategoricalArrays.jl` package, we can add levels that
represent the ordering of our categorical variable to our data:

```language-julia
function fix_age_column(df)
    levels = ["infant", "adolescent", "adult"]
    ages = categorical(df[!, :age]; levels, ordered=true)
    df[!, :age] = ages
    df
end
fix_age_column(wrong_types())
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  String      Cat…
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     1  28-01-2018  adolescent
   2 │     2  03-04-2019  adult
   3 │     3  01-08-2018  infant
   4 │     4  22-11-2020  adult
```

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Also note that we are passing the argument
`ordered=true` which tells `CategoricalArrays.jl`’s `categorical`
function that our categorical data is "ordered". Without this any type
of sorting or bigger/smaller comparisons would not be possible.
]

Now, we can sort the data correctly on the age column:

```language-julia
df = fix_age_column(wrong_types())
sort(df, :age)
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  String      Cat…
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     3  01-08-2018  infant
   2 │     1  28-01-2018  adolescent
   3 │     2  03-04-2019  adult
   4 │     4  22-11-2020  adult
```

Because we have defined convenient functions, we can now define our
fixed data by just performing the function calls:

```language-julia
function correct_types()
    df = wrong_types()
    df = fix_date_column(df)
    df = fix_age_column(df)
end
correct_types()
```

```output
4×3 DataFrame
 Row │ id     date        age
     │ Int64  Date        Cat…
─────┼───────────────────────────────
   1 │     1  2018-01-28  adolescent
   2 │     2  2019-04-03  adult
   3 │     3  2018-08-01  infant
   4 │     4  2020-11-22  adult
```

Since age in our data is ordinal (`ordered=true`), we can properly
compare categories of age:

```language-julia
df = correct_types()
a = df[1, :age]
b = df[2, :age]
a < b
```

```output

true
```

which would give wrong comparisons if the element type were strings:

```language-julia
"infant" < "adult"
```

```output

false
```

== Join
<sec:join>
At the start of this chapter, we showed multiple tables and raised
questions also related to multiple tables. However, we haven’t talked
about combining tables yet, which we will do in this section. In
`DataFrames.jl`, combining multiple tables is done via #emph[joins];.
Joins are extremely powerful, but it might take a while to wrap your
head around them. It is not necessary to know the joins below by heart,
because the
#link("https://DataFrames.juliadata.org/stable/man/joins/")[`DataFrames.jl` documentation];,
along with this book, will list them for you. But, it’s essential to
know that joins exist. If you ever find yourself looping over rows in a
`DataFrame` and comparing it with other data, then you probably need one
of the joins below.

In Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];, we’ve introduced the grades for
2020 with `grades_2020`:

```language-julia
grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Now, we’re going to combine `grades_2020` with grades from 2021:

```language-julia
grades_2021()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Bob 2], [9.5],
    [Sally], [9.5],
    [Hank], [6.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

To do this, we are going to use joins. `DataFrames.jl` lists no less
than seven kinds of join. This might seem daunting at first, but hang on
because they are all useful and we will showcase them all.

=== innerjoin
<sec:innerjoin>
This first is #strong[`innerjoin`];. Suppose that we have two datasets
`A` and `B` with respectively columns `A_1, A_2, ..., A_n` and
`B_1, B_2, ..., B_m` #strong[and] one of the columns has the same name,
say `A_1` and `B_1` are both called `:id`. Then, the inner join on `:id`
will go through all the elements in `A_1` and compare it to the elements
in `B_1`. If the elements are #strong[the same];, then it will add all
the information from `A_2, ..., A_n` and `B_2, ..., B_m` after the `:id`
column.

Okay, so no worries if you didn’t get this description. The result on
the grades datasets looks like this:

```language-julia
innerjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Note that only "Sally" and "Hank" are in both datasets. The name
#emph[inner] join makes sense since, in mathematics, the #emph[set
intersection] is defined by "all elements in $A$, that are also in $B$,
or all elements in $B$ that are also in $A$".

=== outerjoin
<sec:outerjoin>
Maybe you’re now thinking "aha, if we have an #emph[inner];, then we
probably also have an #emph[outer];". Yes, you’ve guessed right!

The #strong[`outerjoin`] is much less strict than the `innerjoin` and
just takes any row it can find which contains a name in #strong[at least
one of the datasets];:

```language-julia
outerjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [missing],
    [Alice], [8.5], [missing],
    [Bob 2], [missing], [9.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

So, this method can create `missing` data even though none of the
original datasets had missing values.

=== crossjoin
<sec:crossjoin>
We can get even more `missing` data if we use the #strong[`crossjoin`];.
This gives the #strong[Cartesian product of the rows];, which is
basically multiplication of rows, that is, for every row create a
combination with any other row:

```language-julia
crossjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:id)
```

```output
MethodError: no method matching crossjoin(::DataFrame, ::DataFrame; on::Symbol)
This error has been manually thrown, explicitly, so the method may exist but be intentionally marked as unimplemented.

Closest candidates are:
  crossjoin(::DataFrames.AbstractDataFrame, ::DataFrames.AbstractDataFrame; makeunique, renamecols) got unsupported keyword argument "on"
   @ DataFrames ~/.julia/packages/DataFrames/rwKZk/src/join/composer.jl:1567
  crossjoin(::DataFrames.AbstractDataFrame, ::DataFrames.AbstractDataFrame, DataFrames.AbstractDataFrame...; makeunique) got unsupported keyword argument "on"
   @ DataFrames ~/.julia/packages/DataFrames/rwKZk/src/join/composer.jl:1591

  ...
```

Oops. Since `crossjoin` doesn’t take the elements in the row into
account, we don’t need to specify the `on` argument for what we want to
join:

```language-julia
crossjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021())
```

```output
ArgumentError: Duplicate variable names: :name. Pass makeunique=true to make them unique using a suffix automatically.
Stacktrace:

  [5] #Index#7
    @ ~/.julia/packages/DataFrames/rwKZk/src/other/index.jl:27 [inlined]
  [6] Index
  ...
```

Oops again. This is a very common error with `DataFrame`s and `join`s.
The tables for the 2020 and 2021 grades have a duplicate column name,
namely `:name`. Like before, the error that `DataFrames.jl` outputs
shows a simple suggestion that might fix the issue. We can just pass
`makeunique=true` to solve this:

```language-julia
crossjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); makeunique=true)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (7.23%, 32.53%, 27.71%, 32.53%),
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [name\_1], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [Bob 2], [9.5],
    [Sally], [1.0], [Sally], [9.5],
    [Sally], [1.0], [Hank], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [Bob 2], [9.5],
    [Bob], [5.0], [Sally], [9.5],
    [Bob], [5.0], [Hank], [6.0],
    [Alice], [8.5], [Bob 2], [9.5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [Sally], [9.5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [Hank], [6.0],
    [Hank], [4.0], [Bob 2], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [Sally], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [Hank], [6.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

So, now, we have one row for each grade from everyone in grades 2020 and
grades 2021 datasets. For direct queries, such as "who has the highest
grade?", the Cartesian product is usually not so useful, but for
"statistical" queries, it can be.

=== leftjoin and rightjoin
<sec:leftjoin_rightjoin>
#strong[More useful for scientific data projects are the `leftjoin` and
`rightjoin`];. The left join gives all the elements in the #emph[left]
`DataFrame`:

```language-julia
leftjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [missing],
    [Alice], [8.5], [missing],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Here, grades for "Bob" and "Alice" were `missing` in the grades 2021
table, so that’s why there are also `missing` elements. The right join
does sort of the opposite:

```language-julia
rightjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob 2], [missing], [9.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Now, grades in 2020 are missing.

Note that #strong[`leftjoin(A, B) != rightjoin(B, A)`];, because the
order of the columns will differ. For example, compare the output below
to the previous output:

```language-julia
leftjoin(grades_2021(), grades_2020(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2021], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [9.5], [1.0],
    [Hank], [6.0], [4.0],
    [Bob 2], [9.5], [missing],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

=== semijoin and antijoin
<sec:semijoin_antijoin>
Lastly, we have the #strong[`semijoin`] and #strong[`antijoin`];.

The semi join is even more restrictive than the inner join. It returns
#strong[only the elements from the left `DataFrame` which are in both
`DataFrame`s];. This is like a combination of the left join with the
inner join.

```language-julia
semijoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The opposite of the semi join is the anti join. It returns #strong[only
the elements from the left `DataFrame` which are #emph[not] in the right
`DataFrame`];:

```language-julia
antijoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Variable Transformations
<sec:transform>
In Section~#link(<sec:filter>)[4.3.1];, we saw that `filter` works by
taking one or more source columns and filtering it by applying a
"filtering" function. To recap, here’s an example of filter using the
`source => f::Function` syntax:
`filter(:name => name -> name == "Alice", df)`.

In Section~#link(<sec:select>)[4.4];, we saw that `select` can take one
or more source columns and put it into one or more target columns
`source => target`. Also to recap here’s an example:
`select(df, :name => :people_names)`.

In this section, we discuss how to #strong[transform] variables, that
is, how to #strong[modify data];. In `DataFrames.jl`, the syntax is
`source => transformation => target`.

Like before, we use the `grades_2020` dataset:

```language-julia
function grades_2020()
    name = ["Sally", "Bob", "Alice", "Hank"]
    grade_2020 = [1, 5, 8.5, 4]
    DataFrame(; name, grade_2020)
end
grades_2020()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Suppose we want to increase all the grades in `grades_2020` by 1. First,
we define a function that takes as argument a vector of data and returns
all of its elements increased by 1. Then we use the `transform` function
from `DataFrames.jl` that, like all native `DataFrames.jl`’s functions,
takes a `DataFrame` as first argument followed by the transformation
syntax:

```language-julia
plus_one(grades) = grades .+ 1
transform(grades_2020(), :grade_2020 => plus_one)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (5.94%, 26.73%, 67.33%),
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2020\_plus\_one],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [2.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [6.0],
    [Alice], [8.5], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Here, the `plus_one` function receives the whole `:grade_2020` column.
That is the reason why we’ve added the broadcasting "dot" `.` before the
plus `+` operator. For a recap on broadcasting please see
Section~#link(<sec:broadcasting>)[3.3.1];.

Like we said above, the `DataFrames.jl` minilanguage is always
`source => transformation => target`. So, if we want to keep the naming
of the `target` column in the output, we can do:

```language-julia
transform(grades_2020(), :grade_2020 => plus_one => :grade_2020)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [2.0],
    [Bob], [6.0],
    [Alice], [9.5],
    [Hank], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can also use the keyword argument `renamecols=false`:

```language-julia
transform(grades_2020(), :grade_2020 => plus_one; renamecols=false)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [2.0],
    [Bob], [6.0],
    [Alice], [9.5],
    [Hank], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The same transformation can also be written with `select` as follows:

```language-julia
select(grades_2020(), :, :grade_2020 => plus_one => :grade_2020)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [2.0],
    [Bob], [6.0],
    [Alice], [9.5],
    [Hank], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

where the `:` means "select all the columns" as described in
Section~#link(<sec:select>)[4.4];. Alternatively, you can also use
Julia’s broadcasting and modify the column `grade_2020` by accessing it
with `df.grade_2020`:

```language-julia
df = grades_2020()
df.grade_2020 = plus_one.(df.grade_2020)
df
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [2.0],
    [Bob], [6.0],
    [Alice], [9.5],
    [Hank], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

But, although the last example is easier since it builds on more native
Julia operations, #strong[we strongly advise to use the functions
provided by `DataFrames.jl` in most cases because they are more capable
and easier to work with.]

=== Multiple Transformations
<sec:multiple_transform>
To show how to transform two columns at the same time, we use the left
joined data from Section~#link(<sec:join>)[4.6];:

```language-julia
leftjoined = leftjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [missing],
    [Alice], [8.5], [missing],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

With this, we can add a column saying whether someone was approved by
the criterion that one of their grades was above 5.5:

```language-julia
pass(A, B) = [5.5 < a || 5.5 < b for (a, b) in zip(A, B)]
transform(leftjoined, [:grade_2020, :grade_2021] => pass; renamecols=false)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (4.62%, 20.77%, 20.77%, 53.85%),
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021], [grade\_2020\_grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5], [true],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0], [true],
    [Bob], [5.0], [missing], [missing],
    [Alice], [8.5], [missing], [true],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can clean up the outcome and put the logic in a function to get a
list of all the approved students:

```language-julia
function only_pass()
    leftjoined = leftjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
    pass(A, B) = [5.5 < a || 5.5 < b for (a, b) in zip(A, B)]
    leftjoined = transform(leftjoined, [:grade_2020, :grade_2021] => pass => :pass)
    passed = subset(leftjoined, :pass; skipmissing=true)
    return passed.name
end
only_pass()
```

```output
["Sally", "Hank", "Alice"]
```

== Groupby and Combine
<sec:groupby_combine>
In the R programming language, #cite(<wickham2011split>, form: "prose")
has popularized the so-called split-apply-combine strategy for data
transformations. In essence, this strategy #strong[splits] a dataset
into distinct groups, #strong[applies] one or more functions to each
group, and then #strong[combines] the result. `DataFrames.jl` fully
supports split-apply-combine. We will use the student grades example
like before. Suppose that we want to know each student’s mean grade:

```language-julia
function all_grades()
    df1 = grades_2020()
    df1 = select(df1, :name, :grade_2020 => :grade)
    df2 = grades_2021()
    df2 = select(df2, :name, :grade_2021 => :grade)
    rename_bob2(data_col) = replace.(data_col, "Bob 2" => "Bob")
    df2 = transform(df2, :name => rename_bob2 => :name)
    return vcat(df1, df2)
end
all_grades()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
    [Bob], [9.5],
    [Sally], [9.5],
    [Hank], [6.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The strategy is to #strong[split] the dataset into distinct students,
#strong[apply] the mean function to each student, and #strong[combine]
the result.

The split is called `groupby` and we give as second argument the column
ID that we want to split the dataset into:

```language-julia
groupby(all_grades(), :name)
```

```language-plain
GroupedDataFrame with 4 groups based on key: name
Group 1 (2 rows): name = "Sally"
 Row │ name    grade
     │ String  Float64
─────┼─────────────────
   1 │ Sally       1.0
   2 │ Sally       9.5
Group 2 (2 rows): name = "Bob"
 Row │ name    grade
     │ String  Float64
─────┼─────────────────
   1 │ Bob         5.0
   2 │ Bob         9.5
Group 3 (1 row): name = "Alice"
 Row │ name    grade
     │ String  Float64
─────┼─────────────────
   1 │ Alice       8.5
Group 4 (2 rows): name = "Hank"
 Row │ name    grade
     │ String  Float64
─────┼─────────────────
   1 │ Hank        4.0
   2 │ Hank        6.0
```

We apply the `mean` function from Julia’s standard library `Statistics`
module:

```
using Statistics
```

To apply this function, use the `combine` function:

```language-julia
gdf = groupby(all_grades(), :name)
combine(gdf, :grade => mean)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_mean],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [5.25],
    [Bob], [7.25],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Imagine having to do this without the `groupby` and `combine` functions.
We would need to loop over our data to split it up into groups, then
loop over each split to apply a function, #strong[and] finally loop over
each group to gather the final result. Therefore, the
split-apply-combine technique is a great one to know.

=== Multiple Source Columns
<sec:groupby_combine_multiple_source>
But what if we want to apply a function to multiple columns of our
dataset?

```language-julia
group = [:A, :A, :B, :B]
X = 1:4
Y = 5:8
df = DataFrame(; group, X, Y)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([group], [X], [Y],),
    table.hline(),
    [A], [1], [5],
    [A], [2], [6],
    [B], [3], [7],
    [B], [4], [8],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

This is accomplished in a similar manner:

```language-julia
gdf = groupby(df, :group)
combine(gdf, [:X, :Y] .=> mean; renamecols=false)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([group], [X], [Y],),
    table.hline(),
    [A], [1.5], [5.5],
    [B], [3.5], [7.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Note that we’ve used the dot `.` operator before the right arrow `=>` to
indicate that the `mean` has to be applied to multiple source columns
`[:X, :Y]`.

To use composable functions, a simple way is to create a function that
does the intended composable transformations. For instance, for a series
of values, let’s first take the `mean` followed by `round` to a whole
number (also known as an integer `Int`):

```language-julia
gdf = groupby(df, :group)
rounded_mean(data_col) = round(Int, mean(data_col))
combine(gdf, [:X, :Y] .=> rounded_mean; renamecols=false)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([group], [X], [Y],),
    table.hline(),
    [A], [2], [6],
    [B], [4], [8],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Missing Data
<sec:missing>
Let’s dive into how to #strong[handle missing values] in
`DataFrames.jl`. We’ll cover #strong[three] main approaches for dealing
with missing data:

+ #strong[filtering missing] values with `ismissing` and `dropmissing`
+ #strong[filling or replacing missing] values with `coalesce`
+ #strong[skipping over missing] values with `skipmissing`

First, we need a `DataFrame` filled with missing values to showcase
these approaches:

```language-julia
df_missing = DataFrame(;
    name=[missing, "Sally", "Alice", "Hank"],
    age=[17, missing, 20, 19],
    grade_2020=[5.0, 1.0, missing, 4.0],
)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [missing], [17], [5.0],
    [Sally], [missing], [1.0],
    [Alice], [20], [missing],
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

This is the same `DataFrame` from Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4] but
with some `missing` values added.

=== `Missing` type
<sec:missing_type>
Some languages have several types to represent missing values. One such
example is R which uses `NA`, `NA_integer_`, `NA_real_`,
`NA_character_`, and `NA_complex_`. #strong[Julia];, on the contrary,
has #strong[only one];: `Missing`.

```language-julia
typeof(missing)
```

```output
Missing
```

As you can see `missing` is an instance of the type `Missing`.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] In the
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/")[Julia Style Guide];,
there’s a guidance to use camel case for types and modules (see
Section~#link(<sec:notation>)[8.2];).
]

The first thing we need to cover for `missing` values is that they
#strong[propagate through several operations];. For example, addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division:

```language-julia
missing + 1
```

```output
missing
```

```language-julia
missing - 1
```

```output
missing
```

```language-julia
missing * 1
```

```output
missing
```

```language-julia
missing / 1
```

```output
missing
```

They also propagate #strong[through equality and comparison operators];:

```language-julia
missing == 1
```

```output
missing
```

```language-julia
missing == missing
```

```output
missing
```

```language-julia
missing > 1
```

```output
missing
```

```language-julia
missing > missing
```

```output
missing
```

That’s why we need to be very cautious when comparing and testing
equalities in the presence of `missing` values. #strong[For equality
testing use the `ismissing` function instead];.

=== Filtering Missing Values
<sec:missing_filter>
Most of the time we want to #strong[remove missing values from our
data];.

Removing `missing`s can be done in two ways:

+ #strong[`dropmissing` function] applied to a whole `DataFrame` or a
  subset of its columns.
+ #strong[`ismissing` function] applied to a filtering procedure (see
  Section~#link(<sec:filter_subset>)[4.3];).

The `dropmissing` function takes as first positional argument a
`DataFrame`, and as an optional second argument either a single column
or a vector of columns by which you’ll want to remove the missing data
from.

By default, if you do not specify column(s), as the second positional
argument, it will remove any observation (row) having `missing` values:

```language-julia
dropmissing(df_missing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Since 3 out of 4 rows had at least one `missing` value, we get back a
`DataFrame` with a single row as a result.

However, if we specify column(s) as the second positional argument to
`dropmissing`, the resulting `DataFrame` will only drop rows that have
`missing` values in the specified column(s).

Here’s a single column with a `Symbol`:

```language-julia
dropmissing(df_missing, :name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [missing], [1.0],
    [Alice], [20], [missing],
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

And now multiple columns with a vector of `Symbol`s:

```language-julia
dropmissing(df_missing, [:name, :age])
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [20], [missing],
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] You can use any of the #emph[column selectors]
described in Section~#link(<sec:select>)[4.4] for the second positional
argument of `dropmissing`.
]

The `ismissing` function tests if the underlying value is of the
`Missing` type returning either `true` or `false`.

You can use negation `!` to use it both ways:

- `ismissing` to just keep the `missing` values.
- `!ismissing` to keep anything but the `missing` values

```language-julia
filter(:name => ismissing, df_missing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [missing], [17], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

```language-julia
filter(:name => !ismissing, df_missing)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [missing], [1.0],
    [Alice], [20], [missing],
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

=== Filling or Replacing Missing Values
<sec:missing_filling>
A common data wrangling pattern is to #strong[replace or fill missing
values];.

Like R (and SQL), Julia has the `coalesce` function. We often use it in
a broadcasted way over an array to fill all `missing` values with a
specific value.

Here’s an example of a vector containing two `missing` values:

```language-julia
coalesce.([missing, "some value", missing], "zero")
```

```output
["zero", "some value", "zero"]
```

You can see that `coalesce` replaces `missing` values with `"zero"`.

We can definitely use it in a transform procedure
(Section~#link(<sec:transform>)[4.7];):

```language-julia
transform(df_missing, :name => ByRow(x -> coalesce(x, "John Doe")); renamecols=false)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [age], [grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [John Doe], [17], [5.0],
    [Sally], [missing], [1.0],
    [Alice], [20], [missing],
    [Hank], [19], [4.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

=== Skipping over Missing Values
<sec:missing_skip>
As we saw on Section~#link(<sec:groupby_combine>)[4.8];, we can use
`combine` to apply summarizing functions to data. However, as explained,
#strong[`missing` values propagate through most operations in Julia];.
Suppose you want to calculate the mean of `:grade_2020` column in our
`df_missing`:

```language-julia
combine(df_missing, :grade_2020 => mean)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([grade\_2020\_mean],),
    table.hline(),
    [missing],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

You can skip missing values in any array or summarizing function by
passing the `skipmissing` function:

```language-julia
combine(df_missing, :grade_2020 => mean ∘ skipmissing )
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (100%),
    align: (right,),
    table.header([grade\_2020\_mean\_skipmissing],),
    table.hline(),
    [3.3333333333333335],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] We are using the function composition operator
`∘` (which you can type with `\circ<TAB>`) to compose two functions into
one. It is just like the mathematical operator:

\$\$f \\circ g (x) = f(g(x))\$\$

Hence, `(mean ∘ skipmissing)(x)` becomes `mean(skipmissing(x))`.
]

== Performance
<sec:df_performance>
So far, we haven’t thought about making our `DataFrames.jl` code
#strong[fast];. Like everything in Julia, `DataFrames.jl` can be really
fast. In this section, we will give some performance tips and tricks.

=== In-place operations
<sec:df_performance_inplace>
Like we explained in Section~#link(<sec:function_bang>)[3.3.2];,
functions that end with a bang `!` are a common pattern to denote
functions that modify one or more of their arguments. In the context of
high performance Julia code, this #emph[means] that #strong[functions]
with `!` will just change in-place the objects that we have supplied as
arguments.

Almost all the `DataFrames.jl` functions that we’ve seen have a \"`!`
twin\". For example, `filter` has an #emph[in-place] `filter!`, `select`
has `select!`, `subset` has `subset!`, `dropmissing` has `dropmissing!`,
and so on. Notice that these functions #strong[do not] return a
new`DataFrame`, but instead they #strong[update] the`DataFrame` that
they act upon. Additionally, `DataFrames.jl` (version 1.3 onwards)
supports in-place `leftjoin` with the function `leftjoin!`. This
function updates the left `DataFrame` with the joined columns from the
right`DataFrame`. There is a caveat that for each row of left table
there must match #emph[at most] one row in right table.

If you want the highest speed and performance in your code, you should
definitely use the `!` functions instead of regular `DataFrames.jl`
functions.

Let’s go back to the example of the `select` function in the beginning
of Section~#link(<sec:select>)[4.4];. Here is the responses `DataFrame`:

```language-julia
responses()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 6,
    align: (right,right,right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1], [q2], [q3], [q4], [q5],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28], [us], [F], [B], [A],
    [2], [61], [fr], [B], [C], [E],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Now, let’s perform the selection with the `select` function, like we did
before:

```language-julia
select(responses(), :id, :q1)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28],
    [2], [61],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

And here is the #emph[in-place] function:

```language-julia
select!(responses(), :id, :q1)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([id], [q1],),
    table.hline(),
    [1], [28],
    [2], [61],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The `@allocated` macro tells us how much memory was allocated. In other
words, #strong[how much new information the computer had to store in its
memory while running the code];. Let’s see how they will perform:

```language-julia
df = responses()
@allocated select(df, :id, :q1)
```

```language-plain
3840
```

```language-julia
df = responses()
@allocated select!(df, :id, :q1)
```

```language-plain
3424
```

As we can see, `select!` allocates less than `select`. So, it should be
faster, while consuming less memory.

=== Copying vs Not Copying Columns
<sec:df_performance_df_copy>
There are #strong[two ways to access a DataFrame column];. They differ
in how they are accessed: one creates a "view" to the column without
copying and the other creates a whole new column by copying the original
column.

The first way uses the regular dot `.` operator followed by the column
name, like in `df.col`. This kind of access #strong[does not copy] the
column `col`. Instead `df.col` creates a "view" which is a link to the
original column without performing any allocation. Additionally, the
syntax `df.col` is the same as `df[!, :col]` with the bang `!` as the
row selector.

The second way to access a `DataFrame` column is the `df[:, :col]` with
the colon `:` as the row selector. This kind of access #strong[does
copy] the column `col`, so beware that it may produce unwanted
allocations.

As before, let’s try out these two ways to access a column in the
responses `DataFrame`:

```language-julia
df = responses()
@allocated col = df[:, :id]
```

```language-plain
236000
```

```language-julia
df = responses()
@allocated col = df[!, :id]
```

```language-plain
0
```

When we access a column without copying it we are making zero
allocations and our code should be faster. So, if you don’t need a copy,
always access your `DataFrame`s columns with `df.col` or `df[!, :col]`
instead of `df[:, :col]`.

=== CSV.read versus CSV.File
<sec:df_performance_csv_read_file>
If you take a look at the help output for `CSV.read`, you will see that
there is a convenience function identical to the function called
`CSV.File` with the same keyword arguments. Both `CSV.read` and
`CSV.File` will read the contents of a CSV file, but they differ in the
default behavior. #strong[`CSV.read`, by default, will not make copies]
of the incoming data. Instead, `CSV.read` will pass all the data to the
second argument (known as the "sink").

So, something like this:

```julia
df = CSV.read("file.csv", DataFrame)
```

will pass all the incoming data from `file.csv` to the `DataFrame` sink,
thus returning a `DataFrame` type that we store in the `df` variable.

For the case of #strong[`CSV.File`, the default behavior is the
opposite: it will make copies of every column contained in the CSV
file];. Also, the syntax is slightly different. We need to wrap anything
that `CSV.File` returns in a `DataFrame` constructor function:

```julia
df = DataFrame(CSV.File("file.csv"))
```

Or, with the pipe `|>` operator:

```julia
df = CSV.File("file.csv") |> DataFrame
```

Like we said, `CSV.File` will make copies of each column in the
underlying CSV file. Ultimately, if you want the most performance, you
would definitely use `CSV.read` instead of `CSV.File`. That’s why we
only covered `CSV.read` in Section~#link(<sec:csv>)[4.1.1];.

=== CSV.jl Multiple Files
<sec:df_performance_csv_multiple>
Now let’s turn our attention to the `CSV.jl`. Specifically, the case
when we have multiple CSV files to read into a single `DataFrame`. Since
version 0.9 of `CSV.jl` we can provide a vector of strings representing
filenames. Before, we needed to perform some sort of multiple file
reading and then concatenate vertically the results into a single
`DataFrame`. To exemplify, the code below reads from multiple CSV files
and then concatenates them vertically using `vcat` into a single
`DataFrame` with the `reduce` function:

```julia
files = filter(endswith(".csv"), readdir())
df = reduce(vcat, CSV.read(file, DataFrame) for file in files)
```

One additional trait is that `reduce` will not parallelize because it
needs to keep the order of `vcat` which follows the same ordering of the
`files` vector.

With this functionality in `CSV.jl` we simply pass the `files` vector
into the `CSV.read` function:

```julia
files = filter(endswith(".csv"), readdir())
df = CSV.read(files, DataFrame)
```

`CSV.jl` will designate a file for each thread available in the computer
while it lazily concatenates each thread-parsed output into a
`DataFrame`. So we have the #strong[additional benefit of
multithreading] that we don’t have with the `reduce` option.

=== CategoricalArrays.jl compression
<sec:df_performance_categorical_compression>
If you are handling data with a lot of categorical values, i.e.~a lot of
columns with textual data that represent somehow different qualitative
data, you would probably benefit by using `CategoricalArrays.jl`
compression.

By default, #strong[`CategoricalArrays.jl` will use an unsigned integer
of size 32 bits `UInt32` to represent the underlying categories];:

```language-julia
typeof(categorical(["A", "B", "C"]))
```

```language-plain
CategoricalVector{String, UInt32, String, CategoricalValue{String, UInt32}, Union{}}
```

This means that `CategoricalArrays.jl` can represent up to $2^32$
different categories in a given vector or column, which is a huge value
(close to 4.3 billion). You probably would never need to have this sort
of capacity in dealing with regular data#footnote[also notice that
regular data (up to 10 000 rows) is not big data (more than 100 000
rows). So, if you are dealing primarily with big data please exercise
caution in capping your categorical values.];. That’s why `categorical`
has a `compress` argument that accepts either `true` or `false` to
determine whether or not the underlying categorical data is compressed.
If you pass #strong[`compress=true`, `CategoricalArrays.jl` will try to
compress the underlying categorical data to the smallest possible
representation in `UInt`];. For example, the previous `categorical`
vector would be represented as an unsigned integer of size 8 bits
`UInt8` (mostly because this is the smallest unsigned integer available
in Julia):

```language-julia
typeof(categorical(["A", "B", "C"]; compress=true))
```

```language-plain
CategoricalVector{String, UInt8, String, CategoricalValue{String, UInt8}, Union{}}
```

What does this all mean? Suppose you have a big vector. For example, a
vector with one million entries, but only 4 underlying categories: A, B,
C, or D. If you do not compress the resulting categorical vector, you
will have one million entries stored as `UInt32`. On the other hand, if
you do compress it, you will have one million entries stored instead as
`UInt8`. By using `Base.summarysize` function we can get the underlying
size, in bytes, of a given object. So let’s quantify how much more
memory we would need to have if we did not compress our one million
categorical vector:

```julia
using Random
```

```language-julia
one_mi_vec = rand(["A", "B", "C", "D"], 1_000_000)
Base.summarysize(categorical(one_mi_vec))
```

```language-plain
4000604
```

4 million bytes, which is approximately 3.8 MB. Don’t get us wrong, this
is a good improvement over the raw string size:

```language-julia
Base.summarysize(one_mi_vec)
```

```language-plain
8000076
```

We reduced 50% of the raw data size by using the default
`CategoricalArrays.jl` underlying representation as `UInt32`.

Now let’s see how we would fare with compression:

```language-julia
Base.summarysize(categorical(one_mi_vec; compress=true))
```

```language-plain
1000544
```

We reduced the size to 25% (one quarter) of the original uncompressed
vector size without losing information. Our compressed categorical
vector now has 1 million bytes which is approximately 1.0 MB.

So whenever possible, in the interest of performance, consider using
`compress=true` in your categorical data.

= DataFramesMeta.jl
<sec:dataframesmeta>
In this chapter we’ll cover
#link("https://juliadata.github.io/DataFramesMeta.jl/stable/")[#strong[`DataFramesMeta.jl`];];,
a package that uses #strong[convenient data wrangling syntax translating
to `DataFrames.jl` commands];. The syntax is similar to the
#link("https://dplyr.tidyverse.org")[`dplyr`] package from R’s
tidyverse. Compared to using pure `DataFrames.jl`, `DataFramesMeta.jl`
commands are typically more convenient to write and more similar to
`dplyr` which makes `DataFramesMeta.jl` particularly suitable for people
familiar with the R programming language.

A major advantage of `DataFramesMeta.jl` is that, contrary to `dplyr`,
there are fewer commands that you need to learn. Specifically we’ll
cover #strong[6 commands];:

- #strong[`@select`];: column selection
- #strong[`@transform`];: column transformation
- #strong[`@subset`];: row selection
- #strong[`@orderby`];: row sorting
- #strong[`@combine`];: data summaries
- #strong[`@chain`];: piping operations

== Macros
<sec:dataframesmeta_macros>
You might have noticed that all `DataFramesMeta.jl` commands start with
an "at" `@` symbol. These commands have a special category in the Julia
language: they are called #strong[macros];.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] Macros are a way to perform
#link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming")[metaprogramming]
in Julia. We won’t cover macro’s basics here. However, if you want to
find out more, please check the
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/")[Julia documentation section on metaprogramming]
and
#link("https://jkrumbiegel.com/pages/2021-06-07-macros-for-beginners/")[Julius Krumbiegel’s blog post on Julia macros];.
]

`DataFramesMeta.jl` macros behave #strong[similar] to `DataFrames.jl`
functions:

- they both take a `DataFrame` as a first positional argument
- they have in-place #emph[mutating] functions (as discussed in
  Section~#link(<sec:df_performance_inplace>)[4.10.1];: the bang `!`
  functions)

Nevertheless, there are some #strong[differences] between using
`DataFrames.jl` functions versus `DataFramesMeta.jl` macros.

First, using parentheses in the macro commands are #emph[optional];, and
it can be replaced by #emph[spaces] instead. For example:

```julia
@select(df, :col)
```

is the same as:

```julia
@select df :col
```

We will be using the space syntax in this chapter.

Second, macros parse #emph[static] commands by default. If you want
#emph[dynamic] parsing you’ll need to add `$` to your syntax. This
happens because macros treat the input as a static string. For example:

```julia
@select df :col
```

will always work because our intended selected column command with the
argument `:col` won’t change in #emph[runtime] (the time that Julia is
executing code). It will always mean the same operation no matter the
context.

Now suppose that you want to use one of the column selectors presented
in Section~#link(<sec:select>)[4.4];. Here, the expression inside the
`@select` macro needs to be parsed #emph[dynamically];. In other words,
it is #emph[not] static and the operation will change with context. For
example:

```julia
@select df Not(:col)
```

Here the columns that we want to select will depend on the actual
columns inside `df`. This means that Julia cannot treat the command as
something that won’t change depending on the context. Hence, it needs to
be parsed dynamically. In `DataFramesMeta.jl`, this is solved by
wrapping parts of the command that needs to be parsed dynamically with
`$()`. The above command needs to be changed to:

```julia
@select df $(Not(:col))
```

This tells `DataFramesMeta.jl` to treat the `Not(:col)` part of the
macro as dynamic. It will parse this expression and replace it by all of
the columns except `:col`.

Third, most of `DataFramesMeta.jl` macros have #strong[two different
versions];: a #strong[#emph[non-vectorized];];, and a
#strong[#emph[vectorized];] form. The non-vectorized form is the default
form and treats arguments as whole columns, i.e., they operate on arrays
whereas the vectorized form has an `r` prefix (as in #strong[r];ows) and
vectorizes all operators and functions calls. This is the same behavior
as adding the dot operator `.` into the desired operation. Similar to
the `ByRow` function from `DataFrames.jl` that we saw in
Section~#link(<sec:subset>)[4.3.2];.

These 3 operations are equivalent:

```julia
# DataFrames.jl
transform(df, :col => ByRow(exp))
```

```julia
# DataFramesMeta.jl non-vectorized (default)
@transform df exp.(:col)
```

```julia
# DataFramesMeta.jl vectorized with r prefix
@rtransform df exp(:col)
```

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] For most of the `DataFramesMeta.jl` macros we
have four variants:

- `@macro`: non-vectorized
- `@rmacro`: vectorized
- `@macro!`: non-vectorized in-place
- `@rmacro!`: vectorized in-place
]

== Column Selection
<sec:dataframesmeta_select>
Let’s revisit our example `all_grades()` data defined in Chapter
#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];:

```language-julia
df = all_grades()
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
    [Bob], [9.5],
    [Sally], [9.5],
    [Hank], [6.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The `DataFramesMeta.jl` `@select` macro is similar to the `select`
`DataFrames.jl` function. It performs #strong[column selection];:

```language-julia
@select df :name
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([name],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally],
    [Bob],
    [Alice],
    [Hank],
    [Bob],
    [Sally],
    [Hank],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can add as many columns as we want to `@select`:

```language-julia
@select df :name :grade
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Hank], [4.0],
    [Bob], [9.5],
    [Sally], [9.5],
    [Hank], [6.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

To use the column selectors (Section~#link(<sec:select>)[4.4];), you
need to wrap them inside `$()`:

```language-julia
@select df $(Not(:grade))
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([name],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally],
    [Bob],
    [Alice],
    [Hank],
    [Bob],
    [Sally],
    [Hank],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

The `DataFramesMeta.jl` syntax, for some users, is easier and more
intuitive than the `DataFrames.jl`’s minilanguage
`source => transformation => target`. The minilanguage is replaced by
`target = transformation(source)`.

Suppose that you want to represent the grades as a number between 0 and
100:

```language-julia
@select df :grade_100 = :grade .* 10
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([grade\_100],),
    table.hline(),
    [10.0],
    [50.0],
    [85.0],
    [40.0],
    [95.0],
    [95.0],
    [60.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Of course, the `.*` can be omitted by using the vectorized form of the
macro, `@rselect`:

```language-julia
@rselect df :grade_100 = :grade * 10
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([grade\_100],),
    table.hline(),
    [10.0],
    [50.0],
    [85.0],
    [40.0],
    [95.0],
    [95.0],
    [60.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Column Transformation
<sec:dataframesmeta_transform>
Whereas the `@select` macro variants performs column selection, the
`@transform` macro variants do #emph[not] perform any column selection.
It can either #emph[overwrite] existent columns or #emph[create] new
columns that will be added to the right of our `DataFrame`.

For example, the previous operation on `:grade` can be invoked as a
transformation with:

```language-julia
@rtransform df :grade_100 = :grade * 10
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade], [grade\_100],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [10.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [50.0],
    [Alice], [8.5], [85.0],
    [Hank], [4.0], [40.0],
    [Bob], [9.5], [95.0],
    [Sally], [9.5], [95.0],
    [Hank], [6.0], [60.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

As you can see, `@transform` does not perform column selection, and the
`:grade_100` column is created as a new column and added to the right of
our `DataFrame`.

`DataFramesMeta.jl` macros also support `begin ... end` statements. For
example, suppose that you are creating two columns in a `@transform`
macro:

```language-julia
@rtransform df :grade_100 = :grade * 10 :grade_5 = :grade / 2
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 4,
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade], [grade\_100], [grade\_5],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [10.0], [0.5],
    [Bob], [5.0], [50.0], [2.5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [85.0], [4.25],
    [Hank], [4.0], [40.0], [2.0],
    [Bob], [9.5], [95.0], [4.75],
    [Sally], [9.5], [95.0], [4.75],
    [Hank], [6.0], [60.0], [3.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

It can be cumbersome and difficult to read the performed
transformations. To facilitate that, we can use `begin ... end`
statements and put one transformation per line:

```language-julia
@rtransform df begin
    :grade_100 = :grade * 10
    :grade_5 = :grade / 2
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 4,
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade], [grade\_100], [grade\_5],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [10.0], [0.5],
    [Bob], [5.0], [50.0], [2.5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [85.0], [4.25],
    [Hank], [4.0], [40.0], [2.0],
    [Bob], [9.5], [95.0], [4.75],
    [Sally], [9.5], [95.0], [4.75],
    [Hank], [6.0], [60.0], [3.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

We can also use other columns in our transformations, which makes
`DataFramesMeta.jl` more appealing than `DataFrames.jl` due to the
easier syntax.

First, let’s revisit the leftjoined `DataFrame` from Chapter
#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];:

```language-julia
leftjoined = leftjoin(grades_2020(), grades_2021(); on=:name)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [missing],
    [Alice], [8.5], [missing],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Additionally, we’ll replace the missing values with `5`
(Section~#link(<sec:missing>)[4.9];, also note the `!` in in-place
variant `@rtransform!`):

```language-julia
@rtransform! leftjoined :grade_2021 = coalesce(:grade_2021, 5)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

This is how you calculate the mean of grades in both years using
`DataFramesMeta.jl`:

```language-julia
@rtransform leftjoined :mean_grades = (:grade_2020 + :grade_2021) / 2
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (6.82%, 30.68%, 30.68%, 31.82%),
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021], [mean\_grades],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5], [5.25],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0], [5.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [5], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5], [5], [6.75],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

This is how you would perform it in `DataFrames.jl`:

```language-julia
transform(leftjoined, [:grade_2020, :grade_2021] => ByRow((x, y) -> (x + y) / 2) => :mean_grades)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (6.82%, 30.68%, 30.68%, 31.82%),
    align: (right,right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021], [mean\_grades],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5], [5.25],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0], [5.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [5], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5], [5], [6.75],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

As you can see, the case for easier syntax is not hard to argue for
`DataFramesMeta.jl`.

== Row Selection
<sec:dataframesmeta_subset>
We already covered two macros that operate on #emph[columns];, `@select`
and `@transform`.

Now let’s cover the only macro we need to #strong[operate on
#emph[rows];: `@subset`] It follows the same principles we’ve seen so
far with `DataFramesMeta.jl`, #emph[except] that the #strong[operation
must return a boolean variable] for row selection.

Let’s filter grades above 7:

```language-julia
@rsubset df :grade > 7
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Bob], [9.5],
    [Sally], [9.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

As you can see, `@subset` has also a vectorized variant `@rsubset`.
Sometimes we want to mix and match vectorized and non-vectorized
function calls. For instance, suppose that we want to filter out the
grades above the mean grade:

```language-julia
@subset df :grade .> mean(:grade)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
    [Bob], [9.5],
    [Sally], [9.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

For this, we need a `@subset` macro with the `>` operator vectorized,
since we want a element-wise comparison, but the `mean` function needs
to operate on the whole column of values.

`@subset` also supports multiple operations inside a `begin ... end`
statement:

```language-julia
@rsubset df begin
    :grade > 7
    startswith(:name, "A")
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Row Sorting
<sec:dataframesmeta_orderby>
#strong[`DataFramesMeta.jl` has a macro for sorting rows: `@orderby`];.
`@orderby` does not have an in-place or vectorized variant.

Let’s sort our `leftjoined` by grade in 2021:

```language-julia
@orderby leftjoined :grade_2021
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Bob], [5.0], [5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

By default, `@orderby` will sort in ascending order. But you can change
this to decreasing order with the minus sign `-` in front of the column:

```language-julia
@orderby leftjoined -:grade_2021
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [5],
    [Alice], [8.5], [5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Like all the other `DataFramesMeta.jl` macros, `@orderby` also supports
multiple operations inside a `begin ... end` statement:

```language-julia
@orderby leftjoined begin
    :grade_2021
    :name
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade\_2020], [grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Alice], [8.5], [5],
    [Bob], [5.0], [5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Here, we are sorting first by grade in 2020 then by name. Both in
ascending order.

== Data Summaries
<sec:dataframesmeta_combine>
Similar to the `combine` `DataFrames.jl` function
(Section~#link(<sec:groupby_combine>)[4.8];), `DataFramesMeta.jl` has a
#strong[`@combine` macro];.

```language-julia
@combine leftjoined :mean_grade_2020 = mean(:grade_2020)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 1,
    align: (right,),
    table.header([mean\_grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [4.625],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

`@combine` also supports multiple operations inside a `begin ... end`
statement:

```language-julia
@combine leftjoined begin
    :mean_grade_2020 = mean(:grade_2020)
    :mean_grade_2021 = mean(:grade_2021)
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (50%, 50%),
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([mean\_grade\_2020], [mean\_grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [4.625], [6.375],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Most of the time we would use `@combine` in a grouped dataframe by
pairing it with `groupby`:

```language-julia
gdf = groupby(leftjoined, :name)
@combine gdf begin
    :mean_grade_2020 = mean(:grade_2020)
    :mean_grade_2021 = mean(:grade_2021)
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (5.88%, 47.06%, 47.06%),
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [mean\_grade\_2020], [mean\_grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [9.5],
    [Hank], [4.0], [6.0],
    [Bob], [5.0], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5], [5.0],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

== Piping Operations
<sec:dataframesmeta_chain>
R users are familiar with the pipe operator `%>%` which allows
#strong[chaining] operations together. That means that the output of an
operation will be used as input in the next operation and so on.

This can be accomplished with the `@chain` macro. To use it, we start
with `@chain` followed by the `DataFrame` and a `begin` statement. Every
operation inside the `begin ... end` statement will be used as input for
the next operation, therefore chaining operations together.

Here is a simple example with a `groupby` followed by a `@combine`:

```language-julia
@chain leftjoined begin
    groupby(:name)
    @combine :mean_grade_2020 = mean(:grade_2020)
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([name], [mean\_grade\_2020],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0],
    [Hank], [4.0],
    [Bob], [5.0],
    [Alice], [8.5],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] `@chain` will replace the first positional
argument while chaining operations. This is not a problem in
`DataFrames.jl` and `DataFramesMeta.jl`, since the `DataFrame` is always
the first positional argument.
]

We can also nest as many as `begin ... end` statements we desired inside
the operations:

```language-julia
@chain leftjoined begin
    groupby(:name)
    @combine begin
        :mean_grade_2020 = mean(:grade_2020)
        :mean_grade_2021 = mean(:grade_2021)
    end
end
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: (5.88%, 47.06%, 47.06%),
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [mean\_grade\_2020], [mean\_grade\_2021],),
    table.hline(),

To conclude, let’s show a `@chain` example with all of the
`DataFramesMeta.jl` macros we covered so far:

```language-julia
@chain leftjoined begin
    @rtransform begin
        :grade_2020 = :grade_2020 * 10
        :grade_2021 = :grade_2021 * 10
    end
    groupby(:name)
    @combine begin
        :mean_grade_2020 = mean(:grade_2020)
        :mean_grade_2021 = mean(:grade_2021)
    end
    @rtransform :mean_grades = (:mean_grade_2020 + :mean_grade_2021) / 2
    @rsubset :mean_grades > 50
    @orderby -:mean_grades
end
```

= Data Visualization with Makie.jl
<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>
#quote(block: true)[
From the japanese word Maki-e, which is a technique to sprinkle lacquer
with gold and silver powder. Data is the gold and silver of our age, so
let’s spread it out beautifully on the screen!

#emph[Simon Danisch, Creator of `Makie.jl`]
]

#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/")[`Makie.jl`] is a
high-performance, extendable, and multi-platform plotting ecosystem for
the Julia programming language. In our opinion, it is the prettiest and
most powerful plotting package.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] There are other plotting packages in the Julia
ecosystem. One of the most popular ones is
#link("https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/")[`Plots.jl`];. However, we
believe that the future of the Julia plotting tooling is in the
`Makie.jl` ecosystem, due to the native Julia codebase and official
support from #link("https://juliahub.com")[JuliaHub];. Therefore, this
is where we’ll focus all of our data visualization efforts.
]

`Makie.jl` deals with arrays (Section~#link(<sec:array>)[3.3.7];), such
as vectors and matrices. This makes `Makie.jl` capable of dealing with
any tabular data and especially `DataFrames` as we covered in
Section~#link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];. Moreover, it uses special point
types, i.e.~`Point2f` and `Point3f` which come in handy when defining
vectors of points in 2d or 3d space.

Like many plotting packages, the code is split into multiple packages.
`Makie.jl` is the front end package that defines all plotting functions
required to create plot objects. These objects store all the information
about the plots, but still need to be converted into an image. To
convert these plot objects into an image, you need one of the Makie
backends. By default, `Makie.jl` is reexported by every backend, so you
only need to install and load the backend that you want to use.

There are four main backends which concretely implement all abstract
rendering capabilities defined in Makie. These are

- `CairoMakie.jl` for non-interactive 2D publication-quality vector
  graphics,
- `GLMakie.jl` for interactive 2D and 3D plotting in standalone
  `GLFW.jl` windows (also GPU-powered), and
- `WGLMakie.jl`, a WebGL-based interactive 2D and 3D plotting that runs
  within browsers.
- `RPRMakie.jl`, an experimental ray tracing backend using AMDs
  #link("https://radeon-pro.github.io/RadeonProRenderDocs/en/index.html")[RadeonProRender];.
  At the time of writing this book this only works on Windows and Linux.

#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/backends/index.html")[See Makie’s documentation for more];.

In this book we will only show examples for `CairoMakie.jl` and
`GLMakie.jl`.

You can activate any backend by using the appropriate package and
calling his corresponding `activate!` function. For example:

```
using GLMakie
GLMakie.activate!()
```

Now, we will start with some basic plots and later one some more
advanced publication-quality plots. But, before going into plotting it
is important to know how to save our plots. The easiest option to `save`
a figure `fig` is to type `save("filename.png", fig)`. Other formats are
also available for `CairoMakie.jl`, such as `svg` and `pdf`. The size of
the output image can easily be adjusted by passing extra arguments. For
example, for vector formats you specify `pt_per_unit`:

```
save("filename.pdf", fig; pt_per_unit=2)
```

or

```
save("filename.pdf", fig; pt_per_unit=0.5)
```

For `png`’s you specify `px_per_unit`. See
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/explanations/figure/#figure_size_and_units")[Exporting a Figure with physical dimensions]
for details.

Another important issue is to actually visualize your output plot. Note
that for `CairoMakie.jl` the Julia REPL is not able to show plots, so
you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as
VSCode, Jupyter or Pluto that supports `png` or `svg` as output. On the
other hand, `GLMakie.jl` can open interactive windows, or alternatively
display bitmaps inline if `Makie.inline!(true)` is called.

== CairoMakie.jl
<sec:cairomakie>
Let’s start with our first plot: some scatter points with a line across
them. Remember, first we call the backend and activate it, namely

```
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!()
```

And then the plotting function, in this case `scatterlines(x,y)` for
points `x=1:10` and `y=1:10`:

```language-julia
fig = scatterlines(1:10, 1:10)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/firstplot.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 3: First plot.
  ]
)
<fig:firstplot>

Note that the previous plot is the default output, which we probably
need to tweak by using axis names and labels.

Every plotting function like `scatterlines` creates and returns a new

- `Figure`
- `Axis`
- `plot object`

in a collection called `FigureAxisPlot`. These are known as the
`non-mutating` methods. On the other hand, the `mutating` methods
(e.g.~`scatterlines!`, note the `!`) just return a plot object which can
be appended into a given `axis` or the `current_axis()`.

The next question that one might have is: how do I change the color or
the marker type? This can be done via `attributes`, which we explain in
the next section.

== Attributes
<sec:datavisMakie_attributes>
A custom plot can be created by using `attributes`. The attributes can
be set through keyword arguments. A list of `attributes` for a plot
object, `pltobj`, can be viewed via `pltobj.attributes` as in:

```language-julia
fig, ax, pltobj = scatterlines(1:10)
pltobj.attributes
```

Asking for help in the `REPL` as `?ablines` or `help(ablines)` for any
given plotting function will show you their corresponding attributes
plus a short description on how to use that specific function. For
example, for `ablines`:

```language-julia
help(ablines)
```

```output
  ablines(intercepts, slopes; attrs...)

  Creates a line defined by f(x) = slope * x + intercept crossing a whole
  Scene with 2D projection at its current limits. You can pass one or multiple
  intercepts or slopes.

  Plot type
  =========

  The plot type alias for the ablines function is ABLines.

  Attributes
  ==========

  alpha = 1.0 — The alpha value of the colormap or color attribute. Multiple
  alphas like in plot(alpha=0.2, color=(:red, 0.5), will get multiplied.

  clip_planes = @inherit clip_planes automatic — Clip planes offer a way to do
  clipping in 3D space. You can set a Vector of up to 8 Plane3f planes here,
  behind which plots will be clipped (i.e. become invisible). By default clip
  planes are inherited from the parent plot or scene. You can remove parent
  clip_planes by passing Plane3f[].

  color = @inherit linecolor — The color of the line.

  colormap = @inherit colormap :viridis — Sets the colormap that is sampled
  for numeric colors. PlotUtils.cgrad(...), Makie.Reverse(any_colormap) can be
  used as well, or any symbol from ColorBrewer or PlotUtils. To see all
  available color gradients, you can call Makie.available_gradients().

  colorrange = automatic — The values representing the start and end points of
  colormap.

  colorscale = identity — The color transform function. Can be any function,
  but only works well together with Colorbar for identity, log, log2, log10,
  sqrt, logit, Makie.pseudolog10, Makie.Symlog10, Makie.AsinhScale,
  Makie.SinhScale, Makie.LogScale, Makie.LuptonAsinhScale, and
  Makie.PowerScale.

  cycle = [:color] — Sets which attributes to cycle when creating multiple
  plots.

  depth_shift = 0.0 — Adjusts the depth value of a plot after all other
  transformations, i.e. in clip space, where -1 <= depth <= 1. This only
  applies to GLMakie and WGLMakie and can be used to adjust render order (like
  a tunable overdraw).

  fxaa = false — Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with fxaa
  (anti-aliasing, GLMakie only).

  highclip = automatic — The color for any value above the colorrange.

  inspectable = @inherit inspectable — Sets whether this plot should be seen
  by DataInspector. The default depends on the theme of the parent scene.

  inspector_clear = automatic — Sets a callback function (inspector, plot) ->
  ... for cleaning up custom indicators in DataInspector.

  inspector_hover = automatic — Sets a callback function (inspector, plot,
  index) -> ... which replaces the default show_data methods.

  inspector_label = automatic — Sets a callback function (plot, index,
  position) -> string which replaces the default label generated by
  DataInspector.

  linecap = @inherit linecap — Sets the type of linecap used, i.e. :butt (flat
  with no extrusion), :square (flat with 1 linewidth extrusion) or :round.

  linestyle = nothing — Sets the dash pattern of the line. Options are :solid
  (equivalent to nothing), :dot, :dash, :dashdot and :dashdotdot. These can
  also be given in a tuple with a gap style modifier, either :normal, :dense
  or :loose. For example, (:dot, :loose) or (:dashdot, :dense).

  For custom patterns have a look at Makie.Linestyle.

  linewidth = @inherit linewidth — Sets the width of the line in pixel units

  lowclip = automatic — The color for any value below the colorrange.

  model = automatic — Sets a model matrix for the plot. This overrides
  adjustments made with translate!, rotate! and scale!.

  nan_color = :transparent — The color for NaN values.

  overdraw = false — Controls if the plot will draw over other plots. This
  specifically means ignoring depth checks in GL backends

  space = :data — Sets the transformation space for box encompassing the plot.
  See Makie.spaces() for possible inputs.

  ssao = false — Adjusts whether the plot is rendered with ssao (screen space
  ambient occlusion). Note that this only makes sense in 3D plots and is only
  applicable with fxaa = true.

  transformation = :automatic — No docs available.

  transparency = false — Adjusts how the plot deals with transparency. In
  GLMakie transparency = true results in using Order Independent Transparency.

  visible = true — Controls whether the plot will be rendered or not.

  ablines has the following function signatures:

    (Vector, Vector)
    (Vector, Vector, Vector)
    (Matrix)

  Available attributes for ABLines are:

    alpha
    clip_planes
    color
    colormap
    colorrange
    colorscale
    cycle
    depth_shift
    highclip
    inspectable
    inspector_clear
    inspector_hover
    inspector_label
    linecap
    linestyle
    linewidth
    lowclip
    nan_color
    overdraw
    space
    ssao
    transparency
    visible
```

Not only the plot objects have attributes, in the next Section we will
see that also the `Axis` and `Figure` objects do.

== Create Plot Figure
<sec:datavisMakie_create_Figure>
The basic container object in Makie is `Figure`, a canvas where we can
add objects like `Axis`, `Colorbar`, `Legend`, etc.

For `Figure`, we have have attributes like `backgroundcolor`, `size`,
`font` and `fontsize` as well as the `figure_padding` which changes the
amount of space around the figure content, see the colored area in
Figure~#link(<fig:fig_axis>)[5];. It can take one number for all sides,
or a tuple of four numbers for left, right, bottom and top. Let’s dive
into these components.

=== Figure
<figure>
```language-julia
function figure_canvas()
    fig = Figure(;
        figure_padding=(5,5,10,10),
        backgroundcolor=:snow2,
        size=(600,400),
        )
end
JDS.figure_canvas()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_figure_canvas_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 4: Figure canvas.
  ]
)
<fig:fig>

=== Figure + Axis
<figure-axis>
`Axis` has a lot more, some of them are `backgroundcolor`, `xgridcolor`
and `title`. For a full list just type `help(Axis)`.

```language-julia
function figure_axis()
    fig = Figure(;
        figure_padding=(5,5,10,10),
        backgroundcolor=:snow2,
        size=(600,400),
        )
    ax = Axis(fig[1,1];
        xlabel="x",
        ylabel="y",
        title="Title",
        )
    fig
end
JDS.figure_axis()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_figure_axis_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 5: Figure and Axis.
  ]
)
<fig:fig_axis>

You can hide decorations and axis’ spines with:

#quote(block: true)[
- `hidedecorations!(ax; kwargs...)`
- `hidexdecorations!(ax; kwargs...)`
- `hideydecorations!(ax; kwargs...)`
- `hidespines!(ax; kwargs...)`
]

Remember, we can always ask for help to see what kind of arguments we
can use, e.g.,

```language-julia
help(hidespines!)
```

```output
  hidespines!(la::Axis, spines::Symbol... = (:l, :r, :b, :t)...)

  Hide all specified axis spines. Hides all spines by default, otherwise
  choose which sides to hide with the symbols :l (left), :r (right), :b
  (bottom) and :t (top).

  hidespines! has the following function signatures:

    (Vector, Vector)
    (Vector, Vector, Vector)
    (Matrix)

  Available attributes for Plot{Makie.hidespines!} are:

  
```

Alternatively, for decorations

```language-julia
help(hidedecorations!)
```

```output
  hidedecorations!(la::Axis; label = true, ticklabels = true, ticks = true,
                   grid = true, minorgrid = true, minorticks = true)

  Hide decorations of both x and y-axis: label, ticklabels, ticks and grid.
  Keyword arguments can be used to disable hiding of certain types of
  decorations.

  See also [hidexdecorations!], [hideydecorations!], [hidezdecorations!]

  hidedecorations!(ax::PolarAxis; ticklabels = true, grid = true, minorgrid = true)

  Hide decorations of both r and theta-axis: label, ticklabels, ticks and
  grid. Keyword arguments can be used to disable hiding of certain types of
  decorations.

  See also [hiderdecorations!], [hidethetadecorations!], [hidezdecorations!]

  hidedecorations! has the following function signatures:

    (Vector, Vector)
    (Vector, Vector, Vector)
    (Matrix)

  Available attributes for Plot{Makie.hidedecorations!} are:

  
```

For elements that #strong[you don’t want to hide];, pass `false`, e.g.,
`hideydecorations!(ax; ticks=false, grid=false)`.

Setting `limits` at once or independently for each axis is done by
calling

#quote(block: true)[
- `limits!(ax; l, r, b, t)`, where `l` is left, `r` right, `b` bottom,
  and `t` top.

You can also do `ylims!(low, high)` or `xlims!(low, high)`, and even
open ones by doing `ylims!(low=0)` or `xlims!(high=1)`.
]

=== Figure + Axis + plot
<figure-axis-plot>
Now, we add a plotting function into our new Axis:

```language-julia
function figure_axis_plot()
    fig = Figure(;
        figure_padding=(5,5,10,10),
        backgroundcolor=:snow2,
        size=(600,400),
        )
    ax = Axis(fig[1,1];
        xlabel="x",
        ylabel="y",
        title="Title",
        )
    lines!(ax, 0.5:0.2:3pi, x -> cos(x)/x;
        color=:black,
        linewidth=2,
        linestyle=:dash,
        )
    fig
end
JDS.figure_axis_plot()
```

<fig:fig_axis_plot>

This example already includes many of the attributes that are typically
used. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a "legend" for
reference, especially if the example has more than one function. This
will make it easier to understand.

=== Figure + Axis + plot + axislegend
<figure-axis-plot-axislegend>
So, let’s `append` another mutation `plot` object and add the
corresponding legends by calling `axislegend`. This will collect all the
`labels` you might have passed to your plotting functions and by default
will be located in the right top position. For a different one, the
`position=:ct` argument is called, where `:ct` means let’s put our label
in the `center` and at the `top`, see Figure
Figure~#link(<fig:plot_legend>)[7];:

```language-julia
function figure_axis_plot_leg()
    fig = Figure(;
        figure_padding=(5,5,10,10),
        backgroundcolor=:snow2,
        size=(600,400),
        )
    ax = Axis(fig[1,1];
        xlabel="x",
        ylabel="y",
        title="Title",
        xgridstyle=:dash,
        ygridstyle=:dash,
        )
    lines!(ax, 0.5:0.2:3pi, x -> cos(x)/x;
        linewidth=2,
        linestyle=:solid,
        label = "cos(x)/x",
        )
    scatterlines!(ax, 0.5:0.2:3pi, x -> -cos(x)/x;
        color=:black,
        linewidth=2,
        linestyle=:dash,
         label = "-cos(x)/x",
        )
    axislegend("legend"; position=:rt)
    fig
end
JDS.figure_axis_plot_leg()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_figure_axis_plot_leg_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 7: Figure, Axis, plot and legend.
  ]
)
<fig:plot_legend>

Other positions are also available by combining #emph[left(l),
center(c), right(r)] and #emph[bottom(b), center(c), top(t)];. For
instance, for left top, use `:lt`.

However, having to write this much code just for two lines is
cumbersome. So, if you plan on doing a lot of plots with the same
general aesthetics, then setting a theme will be better. We can do this
with `set_theme!()` as follows:

```language-julia
set_theme!(;
    size=(600,400),
    backgroundcolor=(:mistyrose, 0.1),
    fontsize=16,
    Axis=(;
        xlabel="x",
        ylabel="y",
        title="Title",
        xgridstyle=:dash,
        ygridstyle=:dash,
        ),
    Legend=(;
        backgroundcolor=(:grey, 0.1),
        framecolor=:orangered,
        ),
    )
```

```output
nothing
```

Plotting the previous figure should take the new default settings
defined by `set_theme!(kwargs)`:

```language-julia
function fig_theme()
    fig = Figure()
    ax = Axis(fig[1,1])
    lines!(ax, 0.5:0.2:3pi, x -> cos(x)/x;
        linewidth=2,
        linestyle=:dash,
        label = "cos(x)/x",
        )
    scatterlines!(ax, 0.5:0.2:3pi, x -> -cos(x)/x;
        color=:black,
        linewidth=2,
        linestyle=:dash,
        label = "-cos(x)/x",
        )
    axislegend("legend"; position=:rt)
    fig
    set_theme!()
end
JDS.fig_theme()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_fig_theme_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 8: Set theme!() example.
  ]
)
<fig:setTheme>

Note that the last line is `set_theme!()`, will reset the default’s
settings of Makie. For more on `themes` please go to
Section~#link(<sec:themes>)[6.5];.

=== Figure + Axis + plot + Legend + Colorbar
<figure-axis-plot-legend-colorbar>
Before moving on into the next section, it’s worthwhile to see an
example where an `array` of attributes is passed at once to a plotting
function. For this example, we will use the `scatter` plotting function
to do a bubble plot.

The data for this could be an `array` with 100 rows and 3 columns, which
we generated at random from a normal distribution. Here, the first
column could be the positions in the `x` axis, the second one the
positions in `y` and the third one an intrinsic associated value for
each point. The latter could be represented in a plot by a different
`color` or with a different marker size. In a bubble plot we can do
both.

```language-julia
using Random: seed!
seed!(28)
xyz = randn(100, 3)
xyz[1:4, :]
```

```output
4×3 Matrix{Float64}:
  0.550992   1.27614    -0.659886
 -1.06587   -0.0287242   0.175126
 -0.721591  -1.84423     0.121052
  0.801169   0.862781   -0.221599
```

Next, the corresponding plot can be seen in
Figure~#link(<fig:bubble>)[9];:

```language-julia
function fig_bubbles(xyz)
    fig = Figure(size=(600,400))
    ax = Axis(fig[1,1]; aspect = DataAspect())
    pltobj = scatter!(xyz[:, 1], xyz[:, 2];
        color=xyz[:, 3],
        label="Bubbles",
        colormap=:plasma,
        markersize=15 * abs.(xyz[:, 3]),
        )
    limits!(-3, 3, -3, 3)
    Legend(fig[1, 2], ax, valign=:top)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, height=Relative(3/4))
    fig
end
JDS.fig_bubbles(xyz)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_fig_bubbles_xyz_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 9: Bubble plot.
  ]
)
<fig:bubble>

where we have decomposed the tuple `FigureAxisPlot` into
`fig, ax, pltobj`, in order to be able to add a `Legend` and `Colorbar`
outside of the plotted object. We will discuss layout options in more
detail in Section~#link(<sec:makie_layouts>)[6.8];.

We have done some basic but still interesting examples to show how to
use `Makie.jl` and by now you might be wondering: what else can we do?

== Cheat Sheets
<sec:makie_cheat_sheets>
What are all the possible plotting functions available in `Makie.jl`? To
answer this question, a #emph[CHEAT SHEET] is shown in
Figure~#link(<fig:cheat_sheet_cairo>)[10];. These work especially well
with the `CairoMakie.jl` backend:

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_cheatsheet_cairomakie_.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [
    Figure 10: Plotting functions: CHEAT SHEET. Output given by
    CairoMakie.
  ]
)
<fig:cheat_sheet_cairo>

For completeness, in Figure~#link(<fig:cheat_sheet_glmakie>)[11];, we
show the corresponding functions #emph[CHEAT SHEET] for `GLMakie.jl`,
which supports mostly 3D plots. Those will be explained in detail in
Section~#link(<sec:glmakie>)[6.9];.

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_cheatsheet_glmakie_.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [
    Figure 11: Plotting functions: CHEAT SHEET. Output given by GLMakie.
  ]
)
<fig:cheat_sheet_glmakie>

Now, that we have an idea of all the things we can do, let’s go back and
continue with the basics. It’s time to learn how to change the general
appearance of our plots.

== Themes
<sec:themes>
There are several ways to affect the general appearance of your plots.
Either, you could use a
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/theming/predefined_themes/")[predefined theme]
or your own custom theme. For example, use the predefined dark theme via
`with_theme(your_plot_function, theme_dark())`. Or, build your own with
`Theme(kwargs)` or even update the one that is active with
`update_theme!(kwargs)`.

You can also do `set_theme!(theme; kwargs...)` to change the current
default theme to `theme` and override or add attributes given by
`kwargs`. If you do this and want to reset all previous settings just do
`set_theme!()` with no arguments. See the following examples, where we
had prepared a `demo_figure` with different characteristics, such that
most attributes for each theme can be appreciated.

Our `demo_figure` plotting function looks like follows:

```language-julia
function demo_figure()
    # contourf
    x=y= range(-2.3, 2.3, length=100)
    z=-2x .* exp.(-x .^ 2 .- (y') .^ 2)
    # density
    μσpairs=[[4,2],[2,0.5],[-1,2],[0.25,1],[-4, 2],[8, 1.5]]
    # lines
    xs=range(0, 4π, 100)
    ys=[sin.(xs),cos.(xs),-sin.(xs),-cos.(xs),0.5cos.(xs),-0.5cos.(xs)]
    labs=["sin(x)","cos(x)","-sin(x)","-cos(x)","cos(x)/2","-cos(x)/2"]
    # figure
    fig = Figure(figure_padding=(10,15,5,35),
        size = (900,600), fontsize = 20)
    ax1 = Axis(fig[1,1]; xlabel="x", ylabel="y")
    ax2 = Axis(fig[1,2]; xlabel="x", ylabel="pdf")
    ax3 = Axis(fig[2,1:2]; xlabel="x", ylabel="y")
    obj = contourf!(ax1, x,y,z; levels=30)
    Colorbar(fig[1,1, Top()], obj;
        vertical=false,
        tellheight=false,
        tellwidth=false,
        valign=:top
        )
    for μσ in μσpairs
        density!(ax2, rand(Distributions.Normal(μσ...),1000);
            label="$(μσ[1]),$(μσ[2])")
    end
    Legend(fig[1,2, Top()], ax2;
        orientation=:horizontal,
        nbanks=2,
        backgroundcolor =:transparent,
        tellheight=false,
        valign=:center,
        )
    limits!(ax2, -10,15,0,1)
    [lines!(ax3, xs, y, label = "$(labs[i])") for (i,y) in enumerate(ys)]
    limits!(ax3, 0,4π,-1,1)
    Legend(fig[2,1:2, Top()], ax3, orientation=:horizontal)
    fig
end
```

Where we had use several keyword arguments for `Axis`, `Legend` and
`Colorbar`, please play with them and see how they work.

Currently, there are five themes:

#quote(block: true)[
- `theme_dark()`
- `theme_black()`
- `theme_ggplot2()`
- `theme_minimal()`
- `theme_light()`
]

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_themes_gallery_.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [
    Figure 12: Predefined themes.
  ]
)
<fig:makie_themes>

Another alternative is defining a custom `Theme` by doing
`with_theme(your_plot, your_theme())`. For instance, the following theme
could be a simple version for a publication quality template:

```language-julia
publication_theme() = Theme(
    fontsize=16,
    font="CMU Serif",
    Axis=(
        xlabelsize=20,xlabelpadding=-5,
        xgridstyle=:dash, ygridstyle=:dash,
        xtickalign=1, ytickalign=1,
        yticksize=10, xticksize=10,
        xlabel="x", ylabel="y"
        ),
    Legend=(framecolor=(:black, 0.5), backgroundcolor=(:white, 0.5)),
    Colorbar=(ticksize=16, tickalign=1, spinewidth=0.5),
)
```

Which, for simplicity we use it to plot `scatterlines` and a `heatmap`.

```language-julia
function plot_with_legend_and_colorbar()
    fig, ax, _ = scatterlines(1:10; label="line")
    hm = heatmap!(ax, range(6, 9, 15), range(2, 5, 15), randn(15, 15);
        colormap=:Spectral_11)
    axislegend("legend"; position=:lt)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 2], hm, label="values")
    colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
    ax.title = "my custom theme"
    fig
end
```

Then, using the previously defined `Theme` the output is shown in Figure
(Figure~#link(<fig:plot_with_legend_and_colorbar>)[13];).

```language-julia
with_theme(plot_with_legend_and_colorbar, publication_theme())
```

#figure(image("_build/im/plot_with_legend_and_colorbar.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 13: Themed plot with Legend and Colorbar.
  ]
)
<fig:plot_with_legend_and_colorbar>

Here we have use `with_theme` which is more convenient for the direct
application of a theme than the `do` syntax. You should use the latter
if you want to include extra arguments to the theme that is going to be
applied.

Now, if something needs to be changed after `set_theme!(your_theme)`, we
can do it with `update_theme!(size=(500, 400), fontsize=18)`, for
example. Another approach will be to pass additional arguments to the
`with_theme` function:

```language-julia
fig = (size=(600, 400), figure_padding=1, backgroundcolor=:grey90)
ax = (; aspect=DataAspect(), xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y")
cbar = (; height=Relative(4 / 5))
with_theme(publication_theme(); fig..., Axis=ax, Colorbar=cbar) do
    plot_with_legend_and_colorbar()
end
```

#figure(image("_build/im/plot_theme_extra_args.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 14: Theme with extra args.
  ]
)
<fig:plot_theme_extra_args>

Where the $x$ and $y$ labels have a Latex format due to `L"..."`. Most
basic Latex strings are already supported by Makie, however to fully
exploit this integration is recommend to also load the package
LaTeXStrings as stated in the next section.

== Using LaTeXStrings.jl
<using-latexstrings.jl>
LaTeX support in `Makie.jl` is also available via `LaTeXStrings.jl`:

```
using LaTeXStrings
```

Simple use cases are shown below
(Figure~#link(<fig:latex_strings>)[15];). A basic example includes LaTeX
strings for x-y labels and legends:

```language-julia
function LaTeX_Strings()
    x = 0:0.05:4π
    lines(x, x -> sin(3x) / (cos(x) + 2) / x;
        label=L"\frac{\sin(3x)}{x(\cos(x)+2)}",
        figure=(; size=(600, 400)), axis=(; xlabel=L"x")
        )
    lines!(x, x -> cos(x) / x; label=L"\cos(x)/x")
    lines!(x, x -> exp(-x); label=L"e^{-x}")
    limits!(-0.5, 13, -0.6, 1.05)
    axislegend(L"f(x)")
    current_figure()
end
```

```language-julia
with_theme(LaTeX_Strings, publication_theme())
```

#figure(image("_build/im/latex_strings.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 15: Plot with LaTeX strings.
  ]
)
<fig:latex_strings>

A more involved example will be one with an equation as `text` and
increasing legend numbering for curves in a plot:

```language-julia
function multiple_lines()
    x = collect(0:10)
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"f(x,a)")
    for i = 0:10
        lines!(ax, x, i .* x; label=latexstring("$(i) x"))
    end
    axislegend(L"f(x)"; position=:lt, nbanks=2, labelsize=14)
    text!(L"f(x,a) = ax", position=(4, 80))
    fig
end
JDS.multiple_lines()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_multiple_lines_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 16: Multiple lines.
  ]
)
<fig:multiple_lines>

Where `latexstring` from `LaTeXStrings.jl` has been used to parse the
string. An alternative to this simple case is `L"%$i x"`, which is used
in the next example.

But, before that, there is another problem, some lines have repeated
colors and that’s no good. Adding some markers and line styles usually
helps. So, let’s do that using
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/theming/#cycles")[Cycles]
for these types. Setting `covary=true` allows to cycle all elements
together:

```language-julia
function multiple_scatters_and_lines()
    x = collect(0:10)
    cycle = Cycle([:color, :linestyle, :marker], covary=true)
    set_theme!(Lines=(cycle=cycle,), Scatter=(cycle=cycle,))
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"f(x,a)")
    for i in x
        lines!(ax, x, i .* x; label=L"%$i x")
        scatter!(ax, x, i .* x; markersize=13, strokewidth=0.25,
            label=L"%$i x")
    end
    axislegend(L"f(x)"; merge=true, position=:lt, nbanks=2, labelsize=14)
    text!(L"f(x,a) = ax", position=(4, 80))
    set_theme!() # reset to default theme
    fig
end
JDS.multiple_scatters_and_lines()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_multiple_scatters_and_lines_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 17: Multiple Scatters and Lines.
  ]
)
<fig:multiple_scatters_and_lines>

And voilà. A publication quality plot is here. What more can we ask for?
Well, what about different default colors or palettes. In our next
section, we will see how to use again
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/theming/#cycles")[Cycles]
and learn a little bit more about them, plus some additional keywords in
order to achieve this.

== Colors and Colormaps
<sec:makie_colors>
Choosing an appropriate set of colors or colorbar for your plot is an
essential part when presenting results. Using
#link("https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Colors.jl")[Colors.jl] is
supported in `Makie.jl` so that you can use
#link("https://juliagraphics.github.io/Colors.jl/latest/namedcolors/")[named colors]
or pass `RGB` or `RGBA` values. Additionally, colormaps from
#link("https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/ColorSchemes.jl")[ColorSchemes.jl]
and
#link("https://github.com/peterkovesi/PerceptualColourMaps.jl")[PerceptualColourMaps.jl]
can also be used. It is worth knowing that you can reverse a colormap by
doing `Reverse(:colormap_name)` and obtain a transparent color or
colormap with `color=(:red,0.5)` and `colormap=(:viridis, 0.5)`.

Different use cases will be shown next. Then we will define a custom
theme with new colors and a colorbar palette.

=== Colors
<colors>
By default `Makie.jl` has a predefined set of colors in order to cycle
through them automatically, as shown in the previous figures, where no
specific color was set. Overwriting these defaults is done by calling
the keyword `color` in the plotting function and specifying a new color
via a `Symbol` or `String`. See this in the following example:

```language-julia
function set_colors_and_cycle()
    # Epicycloid lines
    x(r, k, θ) = r * (k .+ 1.0) .* cos.(θ) .- r * cos.((k .+ 1.0) .* θ)
    y(r, k, θ) = r * (k .+ 1.0) .* sin.(θ) .- r * sin.((k .+ 1.0) .* θ)
    θ = range(0, 6.2π, 1000)

    axis = (; xlabel=L"x(\theta)", ylabel=L"y(\theta)",
        title="Epicycloid", aspect=DataAspect())
    figure = (; size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")

    fig, ax, _ = lines(x(1, 1, θ), y(1, 1, θ); color="firebrick1", # string
        label=L"1.0", axis=axis, figure=figure)
    lines!(ax, x(4, 2, θ), y(4, 2, θ); color=:royalblue1, #symbol
        label=L"2.0")
    for k = 2.5:0.5:5.5
        lines!(ax, x(2k, k, θ), y(2k, k, θ); label=latexstring("$(k)")) #cycle
    end
    Legend(fig[1, 2], ax, latexstring("k, r = 2k"), merge=true)
    colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
    fig
end
JDS.set_colors_and_cycle()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_set_colors_and_cycle_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 18: Set colors and cycle.
  ]
)
<fig:set_colors_and_cycle>

Where, in the first two lines we have used the keyword `color` to
specify our color. The rest is using the default cycle set of colors.
Later, we will learn how to do a custom cycle.

=== Colormap, Reverse
<colormap-reverse>
Regarding colormaps, we are already familiar with the keyword `colormap`
for heatmaps and scatters. Here, we show that a colormap can also be
specified via a `Symbol` or a `String`, similar to colors. Or, even a
vector of `RGB` colors. Let’s do our first example by calling colormaps
as a `Symbol`, `String` and `cgrad` for categorical values. See `?cgrad`
for more information.

```language-julia
figure = (; size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
axis = (; xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y", aspect=DataAspect())
fig, ax, pltobj = heatmap(rand(20, 20); colorrange=(0, 1),
    colormap=Reverse(:viridis), axis=axis, figure=figure)
Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, label = "Reverse sequential colormap")
colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
fig
```

#figure(image("_build/im/Reverse_colormap_sequential.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 19: Reverse sequential colormap and colorrange.
  ]
)
<fig:Reverse_colormap_sequential>

=== Colormap, highclip, lowclip
<colormap-highclip-lowclip>
When setting a `colorrange` usually the values outside this range are
colored with the first and last color from the colormap. However,
sometimes is better to specify the color you want at both ends. We do
that with `highclip` and `lowclip`:

```
using ColorSchemes
```

```language-julia
figure = (; size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
axis = (; xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y", aspect=DataAspect())
fig, ax, pltobj = heatmap(randn(20, 20); colorrange=(-2, 2),
    colormap="diverging_rainbow_bgymr_45_85_c67_n256",
    highclip=:black, lowclip=:white, axis=axis, figure=figure)
Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, label = "Diverging colormap")
colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
fig
```

#figure(image("_build/im/diverging_colormap.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 20: Diverging Colormap with low and high clip.
  ]
)
<fig:diverging_colormap>

But we mentioned that also `RGB` vectors are valid options.

=== Colormap, categorical
<colormap-categorical>
For our next example you could pass the custom colormap #emph[perse] or
use `cgrad` to force a categorical `Colorbar`.

```
using Colors, ColorSchemes
```

```language-julia
figure = (; size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
axis = (; xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y", aspect=DataAspect())
#cmap = ColorScheme(range(colorant"red", colorant"green", length=3))
# this is another way to obtain a colormap, not used here, but try it.
mycmap = ColorScheme([RGB{Float64}(i, 1.5i, 2i) for i in [0.0, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5]])
fig, ax, pltobj = heatmap(rand(-1:1, 20, 20);
    colormap=cgrad(mycmap, 3, categorical=true, rev=true), # cgrad and Symbol, mycmap
    axis=axis, figure=figure)
cbar = Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, label="Categories")
cbar.ticks = ([-0.66, 0, 0.66], ["negative", "neutral", "positive"])
colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
fig
```

#figure(image("_build/im/categorical_colormap.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 21: Categorical Colormap.
  ]
)
<fig:categorical_colormap>

Lastly, the ticks in the colorbar for the categorial case are not
centered by default in each color. This is fixed by passing custom
ticks, as in `cbar.ticks = (positions, ticks)`.

The last case is when passing multiple colors to `colormap`. You will
get an interpolated colormap between those colors. Also, hexadecimal
coded colors are accepted. So, on top of our heatmap let’s put one
semi-transparent point using this.

```language-julia
figure = (; size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
axis = (; xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y", aspect=DataAspect())
fig, ax, pltobj = heatmap(rand(20, 20); colorrange=(0, 1),
    colormap=["red", "black"], axis=axis, figure=figure)
scatter!(ax, [11], [11]; color=("#C0C0C0", 0.5), markersize=150)
Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, label="2 colors")
colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
fig
```

#figure(image("_build/im/colormap_two_colors.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 22: Colormap from two colors.
  ]
)
<fig:colormap_two_colors>

=== Custom cycle
<custom-cycle>
Here, we could define a global `Theme` with a new cycle for colors,
however that is #strong[not the recommend way] to do it. It’s better to
define a new theme and use as shown before. Let’s define a new one with
a `cycle` for `:color`, `:linestyle`, `:marker` and a new `colormap`
default. And add these new attributes to our previous
`publication_theme`.

```language-julia
function new_cycle_theme()
    # https://nanx.me/ggsci/reference/pal_locuszoom.html
    my_colors = ["#D43F3AFF", "#EEA236FF", "#5CB85CFF", "#46B8DAFF",
        "#357EBDFF", "#9632B8FF", "#B8B8B8FF"]
    cycle = Cycle([:color, :linestyle, :marker], covary=true) # altogether
    my_markers = [:circle, :rect, :utriangle, :dtriangle, :diamond,
        :pentagon, :cross, :xcross]
    my_linestyle = [:solid, :dash, :dot, :dashdot, :dashdotdot]
    Theme(
        fontsize=16, font="CMU Serif",
        colormap=:linear_bmy_10_95_c78_n256,
        palette=(color=my_colors, marker=my_markers, linestyle=my_linestyle),
        Lines=(cycle=cycle,),
        Scatter=(cycle=cycle,),
        Axis=(xlabelsize=20,xlabelpadding=-5,
            xgridstyle=:dash, ygridstyle=:dash,
            xtickalign=1, ytickalign=1,
            yticksize=10, xticksize=10,
            xlabel="x", ylabel="y"),
        Legend=(framecolor=(:black, 0.5), backgroundcolor=(:white, 0.5)),
        Colorbar=(ticksize=16, tickalign=1, spinewidth=0.5),
    )
end
```

And apply it to a plotting function like the following:

```language-julia
function scatters_and_lines()
    x = collect(0:10)
    xh = range(4, 6, 25)
    yh = range(70, 95, 25)
    h = randn(25, 25)
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400), font="CMU Serif")
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1]; xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"f(x,a)")
    for i in x
        lines!(ax, x, i .* x; label=latexstring("$(i) x"))
        scatter!(ax, x, i .* x; markersize=13, strokewidth=0.25,
            label=latexstring("$(i) x"))
    end
    hm = heatmap!(xh, yh, h)
    axislegend(L"f(x)"; merge=true, position=:lt, nbanks=2, labelsize=14)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 2], hm, label="new default colormap")
    limits!(ax, -0.5, 10.5, -5, 105)
    colgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    fig
end
```

```language-julia
with_theme(scatters_and_lines, new_cycle_theme())
```

#figure(image("_build/im/custom_cycle.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 23: Custom theme with new cycle and colormap.
  ]
)
<fig:custom_cycle>

At this point you should be able to have #strong[complete control] over
your colors, line styles, markers and colormaps for your plots. Next, we
will dive into how to manage and control #strong[layouts];.

== Layouts
<sec:makie_layouts>
A complete #emph[canvas/layout] is defined by `Figure`, which can be
filled with content after creation. We will start with a simple
arrangement of one `Axis`, one `Legend` and one `Colorbar`. For this
task we can think of the canvas as an arrangement of `rows` and
`columns` in indexing a `Figure` much like a regular `Array`/`Matrix`.
The `Axis` content will be in #emph[row 1, column 1];, e.g.~`fig[1, 1]`,
the `Colorbar` in #emph[row 1, column 2];, namely `fig[1, 2]`. And the
`Legend` in #emph[row 2] and across #emph[column 1 and 2];, namely
`fig[2, 1:2]`.

```language-julia
function first_layout()
    seed!(123)
    x, y, z = randn(6), randn(6), randn(6)
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400), backgroundcolor=:snow2)
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], backgroundcolor=:white)
    pltobj = scatter!(ax, x, y; color=z, label="scatters")
    lines!(ax, x, 1.1y; label="line")
    Legend(fig[2, 1:2], ax, "labels", orientation=:horizontal)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, label="colorbar")
    fig
end
JDS.first_layout()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_first_layout_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 24: First Layout.
  ]
)
<fig:first_layout>

This does look good already, but it could be better. We could fix
spacing problems using the following keywords and methods:

- `figure_padding=(left, right, bottom, top)`
- `padding=(left, right, bottom, top)`

Taking into account the actual size for a `Legend` or `Colorbar` is done
by

#quote(block: true)[
- `tellheight=true` or `false`
- `tellwidth=true` or `false`

#emph[Setting these to `true` will take into account the actual size
(height or width) for a `Legend` or `Colorbar`];. Consequently, things
will be resized accordingly.
]

The space between columns and rows is specified as

#quote(block: true)[
- `colgap!(fig.layout, col, separation)`
- `rowgap!(fig.layout, row, separation)`

#emph[Column gap] (`colgap!`), if `col` is given then the gap will be
applied to that specific column. #emph[Row gap] (`rowgap!`), if `row` is
given then the gap will be applied to that specific row.
]

Also, we will see how to put content into the #strong[protrusions];,
#emph[i.e.] the space reserved for #emph[title: `x` and `y`; either
`ticks` or `label`];. We do this by plotting into
`fig[i, j, protrusion]` where #emph[`protrusion`] can be `Left()`,
`Right()`, `Bottom()` and `Top()`, or for each corner `TopLeft()`,
`TopRight()`, `BottomRight()`, `BottomLeft()`. See below how these
options are being used:

```language-julia
function first_layout_fixed()
    seed!(123)
    x, y, z = randn(6), randn(6), randn(6)
    fig = Figure(figure_padding=(0, 3, 5, 2), size=(600, 400),
        backgroundcolor=:snow2, font="CMU Serif")
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y",
        title="Layout example", backgroundcolor=:white)
    pltobj = scatter!(ax, x, y; color=z, label="scatters")
    lines!(ax, x, 1.1y; label="line")
    Legend(fig[2, 1:2], ax, "Labels", orientation=:horizontal,
        tellheight=true, titleposition=:left)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 2], pltobj, label="colorbar")
    # additional aesthetics
    Box(fig[1, 1, Right()], color=(:snow4, 0.35))
    Label(fig[1, 1, Right()], "protrusion", fontsize=18,
        rotation=pi / 2, padding=(3, 3, 3, 3))
    Label(fig[1, 1, TopLeft()], "(a)", fontsize=18, padding=(0, 3, 8, 0))
    colgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    rowgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    fig
end
JDS.first_layout_fixed()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_first_layout_fixed_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 25: First Layout Fixed.
  ]
)
<fig:first_layout_fixed>

Here, having the label `(a)` in the `TopLeft()` is probably not
necessary, this will only make sense for more than one plot. Also, note
the use of `padding`, which allows more fine control over his position.

For our next example let’s keep using the previous tools and some more
to create a richer and complex figure.

Having the same limits across different plots can be done via your
`Axis` with:

#quote(block: true)[
- `linkaxes!`, `linkyaxes!` and `linkxaxes!`

This could be useful when shared axis are desired. Another way of
getting shared axis will be by setting `limits!`.
]

Now, the example:

```language-julia
function complex_layout_double_axis()
    seed!(123)
    x = range(0, 1, 10)
    y = range(0, 1, 10)
    z = rand(10, 10)
    fig = Figure(size=(700, 400),
        font="CMU Serif",
        backgroundcolor=:snow2
        )
    ax1 = Axis(fig, xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"y")
    ax2 = Axis(fig, xlabel=L"x")
    heatmap!(ax1, x, y, z; colorrange=(0, 1))
    series!(ax2, abs.(z[1:4, :]);
        labels=["lab $i" for i = 1:4], color=:Set1_4)
    hm = scatter!(10x, y; color=z[1, :], label="dots", colorrange=(0, 1))
    hideydecorations!(ax2, ticks=false, grid=false)
    linkyaxes!(ax1, ax2)
    #layout
    fig[1, 1] = ax1
    fig[1, 2] = ax2
    Label(fig[1, 1, TopLeft()], "(a)", fontsize=18, padding=(0, 6, 8, 0))
    Label(fig[1, 2, TopLeft()], "(b)", fontsize=18, padding=(0, 6, 8, 0))
    Colorbar(fig[2, 1:2], hm, label="colorbar",
        vertical=false, flipaxis=false
        )
    Legend(fig[1, 3], ax2, "Legend")
    colgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    rowgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    fig
end
JDS.complex_layout_double_axis()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_complex_layout_double_axis_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 26: Complex layout double axis.
  ]
)
<fig:complex_layout_double_axis>

So, now our `Colorbar` is horizontal and the bar ticks are in the lower
part. This is done by setting `vertical=false` and `flipaxis=false`.
Additionally, note that we can call many `Axis` into `fig`, or even
`Colorbar`’s and `Legend`’s, and then afterwards build the layout.

Another common layout is a grid of squares for heatmaps:

```language-julia
function squares_layout()
    seed!(123)
    letters = reshape(collect('a':'d'), (2, 2))
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400), fontsize=14, font="CMU Serif",
        backgroundcolor=:snow2)
    axs = [Axis(fig[i, j], aspect=DataAspect()) for i = 1:2, j = 1:2]
    hms = [heatmap!(axs[i, j], randn(10, 10), colorrange=(-2, 2))
           for i = 1:2, j = 1:2]
    Colorbar(fig[1:2, 3], hms[1], label="colorbar")
    [Label(fig[i, j, TopLeft()], "($(letters[i, j]))", fontsize=16,
        padding=(-2, 0, -20, 0)) for i = 1:2, j = 1:2]
    colgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    rowgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    fig
end
JDS.squares_layout()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_squares_layout_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 27: Squares layout.
  ]
)
<fig:squares_layout>

where all labels are in the #strong[protrusions] and each `Axis` has an
`AspectData()` ratio. The `Colorbar` is located in the third column and
expands from row 1 up to row 2.

The next case uses the so called `Mixed()` #strong[alignmode];, which is
especially useful when dealing with large empty spaces between `Axis`
due to long ticks. Also, the `Dates` module from Julia’s standard
library will be needed for this example.

```
using Dates
```

```language-julia
function mixed_mode_layout()
    seed!(123)
    longlabels = ["$(today() - Day(1))", "$(today())", "$(today() + Day(1))"]
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400), fontsize=12,
        backgroundcolor=:snow2, font="CMU Serif")
    ax1 = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel="x", alignmode=Mixed(bottom=0))
    ax2 = Axis(fig[1, 2], xticklabelrotation=π/2, alignmode=Mixed(bottom=0),
        xticks=([1, 5, 10], longlabels))
    ax3 = Axis(fig[2, 1:2])
    ax4 = Axis(fig[3, 1:2])
    axs = [ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4]
    [lines!(ax, 1:10, rand(10)) for ax in axs]
    hidexdecorations!(ax3; ticks=false, grid=false)
    Box(fig[2:3, 1:2, Right()], color=(:snow4, 0.35))
    Label(fig[2:3, 1:2, Right()], "protrusion", rotation=π/2, fontsize=14,
        padding=(3, 3, 3, 3))
    Label(fig[1, 1:2, Top()], "Mixed alignmode", fontsize=16,
        padding=(0, 0, 15, 0))
    colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Auto(2))
    rowsize!(fig.layout, 2, Auto(0.5))
    rowsize!(fig.layout, 3, Auto(0.5))
    rowgap!(fig.layout, 1, 15)
    rowgap!(fig.layout, 2, 0)
    colgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    fig
end
JDS.mixed_mode_layout()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_mixed_mode_layout_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 28: Mixed mode layout.
  ]
)
<fig:mixed_mode_layout>

Here, the argument `alignmode=Mixed(bottom=0)` is shifting the bounding
box to the bottom, so that this will align with the panel on the left
filling the space.

Also, see how `colsize!` and `rowsize!` are being used for different
columns and rows. You could also put a number instead of `Auto()` but
then everything will be fixed. And, additionally, one could also give a
`height` or `width` when defining the `Axis`, as in
`Axis(fig, height=50)` which will be fixed as well.

=== Nested `Axis` (#emph[subplots];)
<nested-axis-subplots>
It is also possible to define a set of `Axis` (#emph[subplots];)
explicitly, and use it to build a main figure with several rows and
columns. For instance, the following is a "complicated" arrangement of
`Axis`:

```language-julia
function nested_sub_plot!(f)
    backgroundcolor = rand(resample_cmap(:Pastel1_6, 6, alpha=0.25))
    ax1 = Axis(f[1, 1]; backgroundcolor)
    ax2 = Axis(f[1, 2]; backgroundcolor)
    ax3 = Axis(f[2, 1:2]; backgroundcolor)
    ax4 = Axis(f[1:2, 3]; backgroundcolor)
    return (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4)
end
```

which, when used to build a more complex figure by doing several calls,
we obtain:

```language-julia
function main_figure()
    fig = Figure()
    Axis(fig[1, 1])
    nested_sub_plot!(fig[1, 2])
    nested_sub_plot!(fig[1, 3])
    nested_sub_plot!(fig[2, 1:3])
    fig
end
JDS.main_figure()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_main_figure_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 29: Main figure.
  ]
)
<fig:main_figure>

Note that different subplot functions can be called here. Also, each
`Axis` here is an independent part of `Figure`. So that, if you need to
do some `rowgap!`’s or `colsize!`’s operations, you will need to do it
in each one of them independently or to all of them together.

For grouped `Axis` (#emph[subplots];) we can use `GridLayout()` which,
then, could be used to compose a more complicated `Figure`.

=== Nested GridLayout
<nested-gridlayout>
By using `GridLayout()` we can group subplots, allowing more freedom to
build complex figures. Here, using our previous `nested_sub_plot!` we
define three sub-groups and one normal `Axis`:

```language-julia
function nested_Grid_Layouts()
    fig = Figure(backgroundcolor=RGBf(0.96, 0.96, 0.96))
    ga = fig[1, 1] = GridLayout()
    gb = fig[1, 2] = GridLayout()
    gc = fig[1, 3] = GridLayout()
    gd = fig[2, 1:3] = GridLayout()
    gA = Axis(ga[1, 1])
    nested_sub_plot!(gb)
    axsc = nested_sub_plot!(gc)
    nested_sub_plot!(gd)
    hidedecorations!.(axsc, grid=false, ticks=false)
    colgap!(gc, 5)
    rowgap!(gc, 5)
    rowsize!(fig.layout, 2, Auto(0.5))
    colsize!(fig.layout, 1, Auto(0.5))
    fig
end
JDS.nested_Grid_Layouts()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_nested_Grid_Layouts_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 30: Nested Grid Layouts.
  ]
)
<fig:nested_Grid_Layouts>

Now, using `rowgap!` or `colsize!` over each group is possible and
`rowsize!, colsize!` can also be applied to the set of `GridLayout()`s.

=== Inset plots
<inset-plots>
Currently, doing `inset` plots is a little bit tricky. Here, we show two
possible ways of doing it by initially defining auxiliary functions. The
first one is by doing a `BBox`, which lives in the whole `Figure` space:

```language-julia
function add_box_inset(fig; backgroundcolor=:snow2,
    left=100, right=250, bottom=200, top=300)
    inset_box = Axis(fig, bbox=BBox(left, right, bottom, top),
        xticklabelsize=12, yticklabelsize=12, backgroundcolor=backgroundcolor)
    translate!(inset_box.scene, 0, 0, 10)  # bring content upfront
    return inset_box
end
```

Then, the `inset` is easily done, as in:

```language-julia
function figure_box_inset()
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400))
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], backgroundcolor=:white)
    inset_ax1 = add_box_inset(fig; backgroundcolor=:snow2,
        left=100, right=250, bottom=200, top=300)
    inset_ax2 = add_box_inset(fig; backgroundcolor=(:white, 0.85),
        left=500, right=580, bottom=100, top=200)
    lines!(ax, 1:10)
    lines!(inset_ax1, 1:10)
    scatter!(inset_ax2, 1:10, color=:black)
    fig
end
JDS.figure_box_inset()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_figure_box_inset_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 31: Figure box inset.
  ]
)
<fig:figure_box_inset>

where the `Box` dimensions are bound by the `Figure`’s `size`. Note,
that an inset can be also outside the `Axis`. The other approach, is by
defining a new `Axis` into a position `fig[i, j]` specifying his
`width`, `height`, `halign` and `valign`. We do that in the following
function:

```language-julia
function add_axis_inset(pos=fig[1, 1]; backgroundcolor=:snow2,
    halign, valign, width=Relative(0.5),height=Relative(0.35),
    alignmode=Mixed(left=5, right=5))
    inset_box = Axis(pos; width, height, halign, valign, alignmode,
        xticklabelsize=12, yticklabelsize=12, backgroundcolor=backgroundcolor)
    # bring content upfront
    translate!(inset_box.scene, 0, 0, 10)
    return inset_box
end
```

See that in the following example the `Axis` with gray background will
be rescaled if the total figure size changes. The #emph[insets] are
bound by the `Axis` positioning.

```language-julia
function figure_axis_inset()
    fig = Figure(size=(600, 400))
    ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], backgroundcolor=:white)
    inset_ax1 = add_axis_inset(fig[1, 1]; backgroundcolor=:snow2,
        halign=:left, valign=:center,
        width=Relative(0.3), height=Relative(0.35),
        alignmode=Mixed(left=5, right=5, bottom=15))
    inset_ax2 = add_axis_inset(fig[1, 1]; backgroundcolor=(:white, 0.85),
        halign=:right, valign=:center,
        width=Relative(0.25), height=Relative(0.3))
    lines!(ax, 1:10)
    lines!(inset_ax1, 1:10)
    scatter!(inset_ax2, 1:10, color=:black)
    fig
end
JDS.figure_axis_inset()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_figure_axis_inset_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 32: Figure axis inset.
  ]
)
<fig:figure_axis_inset>

And this should cover most used cases for layouting with Makie. Now,
let’s do some nice 3D examples with `GLMakie.jl`.

== GLMakie.jl
<sec:glmakie>
`CairoMakie.jl` fulfills all our needs for static 2D images. But
sometimes we want interactivity, especially when we are dealing with 3D
images. Visualizing data in 3D is also a common practice to gain insight
from your data. This is where `GLMakie.jl` comes into play, since it
uses #link("http://www.opengl.org/")[OpenGL] as a backend that adds
interactivity and responsiveness to plots. Like before, a simple plot
includes, of course, lines and points. So, we will start with those and
since we already know how layouts work, we will put that into practice.

=== Scatters and Lines
<scatters-and-lines>
For scatter plots we have two options, the first one is
`scatter(x, y, z)` and the second one is `meshscatter(x, y, z)`. In the
former, markers don’t scale in the axis directions and in the latter
they do because they are actual geometries in 3D space. See the next
example:

```
using GLMakie
GLMakie.activate!()
```

```language-julia
function scatters_in_3D()
    seed!(123)
    n = 10
    x, y, z = randn(n), randn(n), randn(n)
    aspect=(1, 1, 1)
    perspectiveness=0.5
    # the figure
    fig = Figure(; size=(1200, 400))
    ax1 = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect, perspectiveness)
    ax2 = Axis3(fig[1, 2]; aspect, perspectiveness)
    ax3 = Axis3(fig[1, 3]; aspect=:data, perspectiveness)
    scatter!(ax1, x, y, z; markersize=15)
    meshscatter!(ax2, x, y, z; markersize=0.25)
    hm = meshscatter!(ax3, x, y, z; markersize=0.25,
        marker=Rect3f(Vec3f(0), Vec3f(1)), color=1:n,
        colormap=:plasma, transparency=false)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 4], hm, label="values", height=Relative(0.5))
    colgap!(fig.layout, 5)
    fig
end

<fig:scatters_in_3D>

Note also, that a different geometry can be passed as markers, i.e., a
square/rectangle, and we can assign a `colormap` for them as well. In
the middle panel one could get perfect spheres by doing `aspect = :data`
as in the right panel.

And doing `lines` or `scatterlines` is also straightforward:

```language-julia
function lines_in_3D()
    seed!(123)
    n = 10
    x, y, z = randn(n), randn(n), randn(n)
    aspect=(1, 1, 1)
    perspectiveness=0.5
    # the figure
    fig = Figure(; size=(1200, 500))
    ax1 = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect, perspectiveness)
    ax2 = Axis3(fig[1, 2]; aspect, perspectiveness)
    ax3 = Axis3(fig[1, 3]; aspect=:data, perspectiveness)
    lines!(ax1, x, y, z; color=1:n, linewidth=3)
    scatterlines!(ax2, x, y, z; markersize=15)
    hm = meshscatter!(ax3, x, y, z; markersize=0.2, color=1:n)
    lines!(ax3, x, y, z; color=1:n)
    Colorbar(fig[2, 1], hm; label="values", height=15, vertical=false,
        flipaxis=false, ticksize=15, tickalign=1, width=Relative(3.55/4))
    fig
end

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_lines_in_3D_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 34: Lines in 3D.
  ]
)
<fig:lines_in_3D>

Plotting a `surface` is also easy to do as well as a `wireframe` and
`contour` lines in 3D.

=== Surfaces, wireframe, contour, contourf and contour3d
<surfaces-wireframe-contour-contourf-and-contour3d>
To show these cases we’ll use the following `peaks` function:

```language-julia
function peaks(; n=49)
    x = range(-3, 3, n)
    y = range(-3, 3, n)
    a = 3 * (1 .- x') .^ 2 .* exp.(-(x' .^ 2) .- (y .+ 1) .^ 2)
    b = 10 * (x' / 5 .- x' .^ 3 .- y .^ 5) .* exp.(-x' .^ 2 .- y .^ 2)
    c = 1 / 3 * exp.(-(x' .+ 1) .^ 2 .- y .^ 2)
    return (x, y, a .- b .- c)
end
```

The output for the different plotting functions is

```language-julia
function plot_peaks_function()
    x, y, z = peaks()
    x2, y2, z2 = peaks(; n=15)
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 400))
    axs = [Axis3(fig[1, i]; aspect=(1, 1, 1)) for i = 1:3]
    hm = surface!(axs[1], x, y, z)
    wireframe!(axs[2], x2, y2, z2)
    contour3d!(axs[3], x, y, z; levels=20)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 4], hm, height=Relative(0.5))
    fig
end
JDS.plot_peaks_function()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_plot_peaks_function_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 35: Plot peaks function.
  ]
)
<fig:plot_peaks_function>

But, it can also be plotted with a `heatmap(x, y, z)`,
`contour(x, y, z)` or `contourf(x, y, z)`:

```language-julia
function heatmap_contour_and_contourf()
    x, y, z = peaks()
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 400))
    axs = [Axis(fig[1, i]; aspect=DataAspect()) for i = 1:3]
    hm = heatmap!(axs[1], x, y, z)
    contour!(axs[2], x, y, z; levels=20)
    contourf!(axs[3], x, y, z)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 4], hm, height=Relative(0.5))
    fig
end
JDS.heatmap_contour_and_contourf()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_heatmap_contour_and_contourf_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 36: Heatmap contour and contourf.
  ]
)
<fig:heatmap_contour_and_contourf>

Additionally, by changing `Axis` to an `Axis3`, these plots will be
automatically be in the x-y plane at `z=0`:

```language-julia
function heatmap_contour_and_contourf_in_a_3d_plane()
    x, y, z = peaks()
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 400))
    axs = [Axis3(fig[1, i]) for i = 1:3]
    hm = heatmap!(axs[1], x, y, z)
    contour!(axs[2], x, y, z; levels=20)
    contourf!(axs[3], x, y, z)
    Colorbar(fig[1, 4], hm, height=Relative(0.5))
    fig
end
JDS.heatmap_contour_and_contourf_in_a_3d_plane()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_heatmap_contour_and_contourf_in_a_3d_plane_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 37: Heatmap contour and contourf in a 3d plane.
  ]
)
<fig:heatmap_contour_and_contourf_in_a_3d_plane>

Something else that is easy to do is to mix all these plotting functions
into just one plot, namely:

```
using TestImages
```

```language-julia
function mixing_surface_contour3d_contour_and_contourf()
    img = testimage("coffee.png")
    x, y, z = peaks()
    cmap = :Spectral_11
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 800), fontsize=26)
    ax1 = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect=(1, 1, 1),
        elevation=π/6, perspectiveness=0.5,
        xzpanelcolor=(:black, 0.75), yzpanelcolor=:black,
        zgridcolor=:grey70, ygridcolor=:grey70, xgridcolor=:grey70)
    ax2 = Axis3(fig[1, 3]; aspect=(1, 1, 1),
        elevation=π/6, perspectiveness=0.5)
    hm = surface!(ax1, x, y, z; colormap=(cmap, 0.95), shading=MultiLightShading)
    contour3d!(ax1, x, y, z .+ 0.02; colormap=cmap, levels=20, linewidth=2)
    # get final limits
    xmin, ymin, zmin = minimum(ax1.finallimits[])
    xmax, ymax, zmax = maximum(ax1.finallimits[])
    contour!(ax1, x, y, z; colormap=cmap, levels=20,
        transformation=(:xy, zmax))
    contourf!(ax1, x, y, z; colormap=cmap,
        transformation=(:xy, zmin))
    Colorbar(fig[1, 2], hm, width=15, ticksize=15, tickalign=1,
        height=Relative(0.35))
    # transformations into planes
    heatmap!(ax2, x, y, z; colormap=:viridis,
        transformation=(:yz, 3.5))
    contourf!(ax2, x, y, z; colormap=:CMRmap,
        transformation=(:xy, -3.5))
    contourf!(ax2, x, y, z; colormap=:bone_1,
        transformation=(:xz, 3.5))
    image!(ax2, -3 .. 3, -3 .. 2, rotr90(img);
        transformation=(:xy, 3.8))
    xlims!(ax2, -3.8, 3.8)
    ylims!(ax2, -3.8, 3.8)
    zlims!(ax2, -3.8, 3.8)
    fig
end
JDS.mixing_surface_contour3d_contour_and_contourf()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_mixing_surface_contour3d_contour_and_contourf_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 38: Mixing surface, contour3d, contour and contourf.
  ]
)
<fig:mixing_surface_contour3d_contour_and_contourf>

Not bad, right? From there is clear that any `heatmap`’s, `contour`’s,
`contourf`’s or `image` can be plotted into any plane via a
`transformation` and that the `planes` can be coloured,
i.e.~`xzpanelcolor=:black`.

=== Arrows and Streamplots
<arrows-and-streamplots>
`arrows2d`/`arrows3d` and `streamplot` are plots that might be useful
when we want to know the directions that a given variable will follow.
See a demonstration below#footnote[we are using the `LinearAlgebra`
module from Julia’s standard library.];:

```
using LinearAlgebra
```

```language-julia
function arrows_and_streamplot_in_3d()
    ps = [Point3f(x, y, z) for x=-3:1:3 for y=-3:1:3 for z=-3:1:3]
    ns = map(p -> 0.1 * rand() * Vec3f(p[2], p[3], p[1]), ps)
    lengths = norm.(ns)
    flowField(x, y, z) = Point(-y + x * (-1 + x^2 + y^2)^2,
        x + y * (-1 + x^2 + y^2)^2, z + x * (y - z^2))
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 800), fontsize=26)
    axs = [Axis3(fig[1, i]; aspect=(1,1,1), perspectiveness=0.5) for i=1:2]
    arrows3d!(axs[1], ps, ns, color=lengths, tiplength=0.25)
    streamplot!(axs[2], flowField, -4 .. 4, -4 .. 4, -4 .. 4,
        colormap=:plasma, gridsize=(7, 7), arrow_size=0.25, linewidth=1)
    fig
end
JDS.arrows_and_streamplot_in_3d()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_arrows_and_streamplot_in_3d_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 39: Arrows and streamplot in 3d.
  ]
)
<fig:arrows_and_streamplot_in_3d>

Other interesting examples are a `mesh(obj)`, a `volume(x, y, z, vals)`,
and a `contour(x, y, z, vals)`.

=== Meshes and Volumes
<meshes-and-volumes>
Drawing meshes comes in handy when you want to plot geometries, like a
`Sphere` or a Rectangle, i.e.~`FRect3D`. Another approach to visualize
points in 3D space is by calling the functions `volume` and `contour`,
which implements
#link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)")[ray tracing]
to simulate a wide variety of optical effects. See the next examples:

```
using GeometryBasics
```

```language-julia
function mesh_volume_contour()
    # mesh objects
    rectMesh = Rect3f(Vec3f(-0.5), Vec3f(1))
    recmesh = GeometryBasics.mesh(rectMesh)
    sphere = Sphere(Point3f(0), 1)
    # https://juliageometry.github.io/GeometryBasics.jl/stable/primitives/
    spheremesh = GeometryBasics.mesh(Tesselation(sphere, 64))
    # uses 64 for tesselation, a smoother sphere
    colors = [rand() for v in recmesh.position]
    # cloud points for volume
    x = y = z = 1..10
    vals = randn(10, 10, 10)
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 400))
    axs = [Axis3(fig[1, i]; aspect=(1,1,1), perspectiveness=0.5) for i=1:3]
    mesh!(axs[1], recmesh; color=colors, colormap=:rainbow, shading=NoShading)
    mesh!(axs[1], spheremesh; color=(:white, 0.25), transparency=true)
    volume!(axs[2], x, y, z, vals; colormap=Reverse(:plasma))
    contour!(axs[3], x, y, z, vals; colormap=Reverse(:plasma))
    fig
end
JDS.mesh_volume_contour()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_mesh_volume_contour_.png"),
  caption: [
    Figure 40: Mesh volume contour.
  ]
)
<fig:mesh_volume_contour>

Note that here we are plotting two meshes into the same axis, one
transparent sphere and a cube. So far, we have covered most of the 3D
use-cases.

Taking as reference the previous example one can do the following custom
plot with spheres and rectangles:

```
using GeometryBasics, Colors
```

For the spheres let’s do a rectangular grid. Also, we will use a
different color for each one of them. Additionally, we can mix spheres
and a rectangular plane. Next, we define all the necessary data.

```language-julia
seed!(123)
spheresGrid = [Point3f(i,j,k) for i in 1:2:10 for j in 1:2:10
    for k in 1:2:10]
colorSphere = [RGBA(i * 0.1, j * 0.1, k * 0.1, 0.75) for i in 1:2:10
    for j in 1:2:10 for k in 1:2:10]
spheresPlane = [Point3f(i,j,k) for i in 1:2.5:23 for j in 1:2.5:10
    for k in 1:2.5:4]
cmap = get(colorschemes[:plasma], range(0, 1, 50))
colorsPlane = cmap[rand(1:50,50)]
rectMesh = Rect3f(Vec3f(-1, -1, 2.1), Vec3f(16, 11, 0.5))
recmesh = GeometryBasics.mesh(rectMesh)
colors = [RGBA(rand(4)...) for v in recmesh.position]
```

Then, the plot is simply done with:

```language-julia
function grid_spheres_and_rectangle_as_plate()
    perspectiveness=0.5
    aspect = :data
    # now the figure
    fig = with_theme(theme_dark()) do
        fig = Figure(size=(1200, 800))
        ax1 = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect, perspectiveness, azimuth=0.72)
        ax2 = Axis3(fig[1, 2]; aspect, perspectiveness)
        meshscatter!(ax1, spheresGrid; color=colorSphere, markersize=1,
            shading=NoShading)
        meshscatter!(ax2, spheresPlane; color=colorsPlane, markersize=0.75,
            backlight=1.0f0)
        mesh!(recmesh; color=colors, colormap=:rainbow, shading=NoShading)
        limits!(ax1, 0, 10, 0, 10, 0, 10)
        fig
    end
    fig
end
JDS.grid_spheres_and_rectangle_as_plate()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_grid_spheres_and_rectangle_as_plate_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 41: Grid spheres and rectangle as plate.
  ]
)
<fig:grid_spheres_and_rectangle_as_plate>

Here, the rectangle is semi-transparent due to the alpha channel added
to the RGB color. The rectangle function is quite versatile, for
instance 3D boxes are easy to implement which in turn could be used for
plotting a 3D histogram. See our next example, where we are using again
the `peaks` function and some additional definitions:

```language-julia
x, y, z = peaks(; n=15)
δx = (x[2] - x[1]) / 2
δy = (y[2] - y[1]) / 2
cbarPal = :Spectral_11
ztmp = (z .- minimum(z)) ./ (maximum(z .- minimum(z)))
cmap = get(colorschemes[cbarPal], ztmp)
cmap2 = reshape(cmap, size(z))
ztmp2 = abs.(z) ./ maximum(abs.(z)) .+ 0.15
```

here $delta x , delta y$ are used to specify the box sizes. `cmap2` will
be the color for each box and `ztmp2` will be used as a transparency
parameter. See the output in the next figure.

```language-julia
function histogram_or_bars_in_3d()
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 800), fontsize=26)
    ax1 = Axis3(fig[1, 1]; aspect=(1,1,1), elevation=π/6,
        perspectiveness=0.5)
    ax2 = Axis3(fig[1, 2]; aspect=(1,1,1), perspectiveness=0.5)
    rectMesh = Rect3f(Vec3f(-0.5, -0.5, 0), Vec3f(1, 1, 1))
    meshscatter!(ax1, x, y, 0 * z; marker=rectMesh, color=z[:],
        markersize=Vec3f.(2δx, 2δy, z[:]), colormap=:Spectral_11,
        shading=NoShading)
    limits!(ax1, -3.5, 3.5, -3.5, 3.5, -7.45, 7.45)
    meshscatter!(ax2, x, y, 0 * z; marker=rectMesh, color=z[:],
        markersize=Vec3f.(2δx, 2δy, z[:]), colormap=(:Spectral_11, 0.25),
        shading=NoShading, transparency=true)
    for (idx, i) in enumerate(x), (idy, j) in enumerate(y)
        rectMesh=Rect3f(Vec3f(i-δx, j-δy, 0), Vec3f(2δx, 2δy, z[idx,idy]))
        recmesh=GeometryBasics.mesh(rectMesh)
        lines!(ax2, recmesh; color=(cmap2[idx, idy], ztmp2[idx, idy]))
    end
    fig
end
JDS.histogram_or_bars_in_3d()
```

  caption: [
    Figure 42: Histogram or bars in 3d.
  ]
)
<fig:histogram_or_bars_in_3d>

Note, that you can also call `lines` or `wireframe` over a mesh object.

=== Filled Line and Band
<filled-line-and-band>
For our last example we will show how to do a filled curve in 3D with
`band` and some `linesegments`:

```language-julia
function filled_line_and_linesegments_in_3D()
    xs = range(-3, 3, 10)
    lower = [Point3f(i, -i, 0) for i in range(0, 3, 100)]
    upper = [Point3f(i, -i, sin(i) * exp(-(i + i)))
        for i in range(0, 3, length=100)]
    fig = Figure(size=(1200, 800))
    axs = [Axis3(fig[1, i]; elevation=π/6, perspectiveness=0.5) for i=1:2]
    band!(axs[1], lower, upper; color=repeat(norm.(upper), outer=2),
        colormap=:CMRmap)
    lines!(axs[1], upper, color=:black)
    linesegments!(axs[2], cos.(xs), xs, sin.(xs); linewidth=5,
        color=1:length(xs))
    fig
end
JDS.filled_line_and_linesegments_in_3D()
```

#figure(image("_build/im/JDS_filled_line_and_linesegments_in_3D_.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 43: Filled line and linesegments in 3D.
  ]
)
<fig:filled_line_and_linesegments_in_3D>

Finally, our journey doing 3D plots has come to an end. You can combine
everything we exposed here to create amazing 3D images!

== A Makie recipe for a DataFrame
<sec:recipe_df>
Unlike other libraries that already support a wide set of input formats
via recipes, i.e.~`Plots.jl`, in `Makie.jl` most of the time we need to
pass the raw data to functions. However, we can also define our own
`recipe` in `Makie.jl`. A `recipe` is your own custom plotting type
command. This extension is done just in `Makie.jl`, which means that
making a new set of plotting rules for your own types is light, namely,
you don’t need the complete plotting machinery available to define them.
This is specially useful if you want to include your own plotting
commands in one of your own packages. However, in order for them to work
you will still need to use one of the backends, i.e., GLMakie or
CairoMakie.

As an example we will code a small #strong[full recipe] for a
`DataFrame`. Please refer to the
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/recipes/")[documentation]
for more details.

A Makie `recipe` consist of two parts, a plot `type` name defined via
`@recipe` and a custom `plot!(::Makie.plot)` which creates the actual
plot via plotting functions already defined.

```language-julia
@recipe(DfPlot, df) do scene
    Attributes(
        x = :A,
        y = :B,
        c = :C,
        color = :red,
        colormap = :plasma,
        markersize = 20,
        marker = :rect,
        colorrange = (0,1),
        label = "",
    )
end
```

Note that the macro `@recipe` will automatically create two new
functions for us, `dfplot` and `dfplot!`, all lowercase from our type
`DfPlot`. The first one will create a complete new figure whereas the
second one will plot into the current axis or an axis of your choosing.
This allows us to plot `DataFrame`s which contains columns named, `x`,
`y`, `z`. Now, let’s take care of our plot definition. We will do a
simple scatter plot:

```
import Makie
```

```language-julia
function Makie.plot!(p::DfPlot{<:Tuple{<:DataFrame}})
    df = p[:df][]
    x = getproperty(df, p[:x][])
    y = getproperty(df, p[:y][])
    c = getproperty(df, p[:c][])
    scatter!(p, x, y; color = c, markersize = p[:markersize][],
        colormap = p[:colormap][], marker = p[:marker][],
        colorrange = (minimum(x), maximum(c)), label = p[:label][])
    return p
end
```

Note the extras `[]` at the end of each variable. Those are due to the
fact that #emph[recipes] in Makie are dynamic, meaning that our plots
will update if our variables change. See
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/documentation/nodes/")[observables]
to know more. Now, we apply our new plotting function to the following
`DataFrame`:

```language-julia
df_recipe = DataFrame(A=randn(10), B=randn(10), C=rand(10))
```

```language-julia
fig, ax, obj = dfplot(df_recipe; label = "test")
axislegend()
Colorbar(fig[1,2], obj)
fig
```

#figure(image("_build/im/dfRecipe.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 44: DataFrames recipe.
  ]
)
<fig:dfRecipe>

The named attributes in the recipe allows us to pass custom names to our
new plotting function. Namely:

```language-julia
df_names = DataFrame(a1=rand(100), a2=rand(100), a3=rand(100))
```

and:

```language-julia
dfplot(df_names; x = :a1, y = :a2, c = :a3, marker = 'o',
    axis = (; aspect=1, xlabel = "a1", ylabel = "a2"),
    figure = (; backgroundcolor = :grey90))
```

#figure(image("_build/im/dfRecipeArgs.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 45: DataFrames recipe with arguments.
  ]
)
<fig:dfRecipeArgs>

Note, that now we are calling by name each column as well as the marker
type, allowing us to use this definition for different DataFrames.
Additionally, all our previous options, i.e., `axis` or `figure` also
work!

= Data Visualization with AlgebraOfGraphics.jl
<sec:aog>
`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` is a higher-level plotting package that uses
`Makie.jl` under the hood. It is geared towards data visualization
workflows with support for `DataFrame`s. `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl`
abstracts away some common patterns in data visualization using an
interface similar to R’s `ggplot2` package.

`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` follows a layered approach to construct
visualizations in a structured manner. There are four main types of
layers:

- #strong[data] layer
- #strong[mapping] layer
- #strong[visual transformation] layer
- #strong[statistical transformation] layer

#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` has some guiding
principles described in their
#link("https://aog.makie.org/stable/philosophy/")[philosophy section];.
]

`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` allows you to construct all of these types of
layers with functions that return a `Layer` object, in which all of the
information necessary will be encoded. You can then perform #strong[two
operations on layers];:

- #strong[multiplication with `*`];: this fuses two or more layers into
  a #emph[single] layer
- #strong[addition with `+`];: this superimposes two or more layers into
  a vector of `Layer`s

Finally, as the name suggests, `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` is an algebra for
`Layer` objects. And, as such, it defines two algebraic properties. Let
`a`, `b` and `c` be `Layer` objects, then the following two properties
hold:

- #strong[associative property];: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`
- #strong[distributive property];: `a  * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a + b)`

To get started with `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl`, you’ll need to load it along
with a desired `Makie.jl` backend (Chapter
#link(<sec:DataVisualizationMakie>)[6];):

```julia
using AlgebraOfGraphics
using CairoMakie
```

== Layers
<sec:aog_layers>
We’ll cover the #strong[data layer] first, which can be created with the
`data` function:

```language-julia
data_layer = data(grades_2020())
```

```output
Layer 
  transformation: identity
  data: AlgebraOfGraphics.Columns{DataFrames.DataFrameColumns{DataFrame}}
  positional:
  named:
```

As you can see, `data` takes any `DataFrame` and returns a `Layer` type.
You can see that we do not have any mapping, visual, or statistical
transformations information yet. That will need to be specified in
different layer type with different functions.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] `data` layers can use any
#link("https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS.md")[`Tables.jl`]
data format, including `DataFrames` and `NamedTuples`.
]

Let’s see how to encode data information in a #strong[mapping layer]
with the `mapping` function. This function has the following signature:

```julia
mapping(
    x, y, z;
    color,
    size,
    ...
)
```

The positional arguments `x`, `y`, and `z` correspond to the X-, Y- and
Z-axis mappings and the keyword arguments `color`, `size`, and so on,
correspond to the aesthetics mappings. The purpose of `mapping` is to
encode in a `Layer` information about which columns of the underlying
data `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` will map onto the axis and other
visualization aesthetics, e.g.~color and size. Let’s use `mapping` to
encode information regarding X- and Y-axis:

```language-julia
mapping_layer = mapping(:name, :grade_2020)
```

```output
Layer 
  transformation: identity
  data: Nothing
  positional:
    1: name
    2: grade_2020
  named:
```

We pass the columns as `Symbol`s in a similar manner as we did for
`DataFrames.jl` (Chapter #link(<sec:dataframes>)[4];) and
`DataFramesMeta.jl` (Chapter #link(<sec:dataframesmeta>)[5];). In the
output, we see that we have successfully encoded both `:name` and
`:grade_2020` columns as the X- and Y-axis, respectively.

Finally, we can use a #strong[visual transformation layer] to encode
which type of plot we want to make. This is done with the `visual`
function which takes a #strong[`Makie.jl` plotting type] as a single
positional argument. All of the mappings specified in the mapping layer
will be passed to the plotting type.

```language-julia
visual_layer = visual(BarPlot)
```

```output
Layer 
  transformation: AlgebraOfGraphics.Visual(BarPlot, {})
  data: Nothing
  positional:
  named:
```

The `visual_layer` is a visual transformation layer that encodes
information about which type of visual transformation you want to use in
your visualization plus keyword arguments that might apply to the
selected plotting type.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] We are using the plotting #emph[type] (`BarPlot`)
instead of the plotting #emph[function] (`barplot`). This is due how
`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` works. You can see all of the available mappings
for all of the plotting types by inspecting their functions either using
Julia’s help REPL, e.g.~`?barplot`, or
#link("https://docs.makie.org/stable/examples/plotting_functions/")[`Makie.jl`’s documentation on plotting functions];.
]

=== Drawing Layers
<sec:aog_layers_draw>
Once we have all of the necessary layers we can fuse them together with
`*` and apply the `draw` function to get a plot. The #strong[`draw`
function] will use all of the information from the layer it is being
supplied and will send it as #strong[plotting instructions to the
activated `Makie.jl` backend];:

```language-julia
draw(data_layer * mapping_layer * visual_layer)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_basic.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 46: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_basic>

`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` will automatically pass the underlying columns of
the mapping layer from the data layer’s `DataFrame` as the X- and
Y-labels.

Note that you can just perform the `*` operations inside `draw` if you
don’t want to create intermediate variables:

```language-julia
plt = data(grades_2020()) * mapping(:name, :grade_2020) * visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_basic_verbose.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 47: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_basic_verbose>

=== Mapping Layer Keyword Arguments
<sec:aog_layers_keyword>
Let’s try to use other mappings such as the keyword arguments `color`
and `dodge` in our bar plot, since they are supported by the `BarPlot`
plotting type. First, let’s revisit our example `all_grades()` data
defined in Chapter #link(<sec:dataframes>)[4] and add a `:year` column:

```language-julia
df = @transform all_grades() :year = ["2020", "2020", "2020", "2020", "2021", "2021", "2021"]
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (right,right,right,),
    table.header([name], [grade], [year],),
    table.hline(),
    [Sally], [1.0], [2020],
    [Bob], [5.0], [2020],
    [Alice], [8.5], [2020],
    [Hank], [4.0], [2020],
    [Bob], [9.5], [2021],
    [Sally], [9.5], [2021],
    [Hank], [6.0], [2021],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Now we can pass the `:year` column to be mapped as both a `color` and
`dodge` aesthetic inside `mapping`:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(
        :name,
        :grade;
        color=:year,
        dodge=:year) *
    visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_color.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 48: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with colors as year.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_color>

`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` creates for us a legend with the underlying
information from the `color` mapping column inside the data layer’s
`DataFrame`.

=== Transformations Inside Mapping Layers
<sec:aog_layers_transformations>
We can also perform #strong[transformations] inside the `mapping`
function. It supports the `DataFrames.jl`’s minilanguage
`source => transformation => target`. Where `source` is the original
column name and `target` is a `String` representing the new desired
label. If we simply use `source => target`, the underlying
transformation will be the `identity` function, i.e., no transformation
is performed and the data is passed as it is. Here’s an example:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(
        :name => "Name",
        :grade => "Grade";
        color=:year => "Year",
        dodge=:year) *
    visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_color_custom.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 49: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with colors as year and custom
    labels.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_color_custom>

Let’s make use of the `transformation` in
`source => transformation => target` to transform our grades scale from
0-10 to 0-100 and also our names to uppercase:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(
        :name => uppercase => "Name",
        :grade => (x -> x*10) => "Grade";
        color=:year => "Year",
        dodge=:year) *
    visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_color_custom2.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 50: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with colors as year, custom
    labels and transformations.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_color_custom2>

As you can see, we can pass both regular or anonymous functions.

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] By default `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` transformations
inside `mapping` are vectorized (broadcasted) by default. Hence, we
don’t need to use the dot operator `.`.
]

== Layouts
<sec:aog_layouts>
`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` supports layouts with plots in multiple rows and
columns, also known as #emph[faceting];. These are specified using the
keywords arguments `layout`, `row` and `col` inside `mapping`. If you
use #strong[`layout`];, `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` will try to use the best
combinations of rows and columns to layout the visualization:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(
        :name,
        :grade;
        layout=:year) *
    visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_layout.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 51: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with automatic layout.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_layout>

However, you can override that by using either `row` or `col` for
multiple rows or multiple columns layouts, respectively. Here’s an
example with `row`:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(:name, :grade; row=:year) *
    visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_row.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 52: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with row layout.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_row>

And, finally, an example with `col`:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(
        :name,
        :grade;
        col=:year) *
    visual(BarPlot)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_col.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 53: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with column layout.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_col>

#quote(block: true)[
#strong[#emph[NOTE:];] You use #emph[both] `row` and `col` one for each
categorical variable.
]

== Statistical Visualizations
<sec:aog_stats>
`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` can perform #strong[statistical transformations]
as layers with five functions:

- #strong[`expectation`];: calculates the mean (#emph[expectation];) of
  the underlying Y-axis column
- #strong[`frequency`];: computes the frequency (#emph[raw count];) of
  the underlying X-axis column
- #strong[`density`];: computes the density (#emph[distribution];) of
  the underlying X-axis column
- #strong[`linear`];: computes a linear trend relationship between the
  underlying X- and Y-axis columns
- #strong[`smooth`];: computes a smooth relationship between the
  underlying X- and Y-axis columns

Let’s first cover `expectation`:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(:name, :grade) *
    expectation()
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_expectation.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 54: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with expectation.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_expectation>

Here, `expectation` adds a statistical transformation layer that tells
`AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` to compute the mean of the Y-axis values for
every unique X-axis values. In our case, it computed the mean of grades
for every student. Note that we could safely remove the visual
transformation layer (`visual(BarPlot)`) since it is the default visual
transformation for `expectation`.

Next, we’ll show an example with `frequency`:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(:name) *
    frequency()
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_frequency.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 55: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with frequency.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_frequency>

Here we are passing just a single positional argument to `mapping` since
this is the underlying column that `frequency` will use to calculate the
raw count. Note that, as previously, we could also safely remove the
visual transformation layer (`visual(BarPlot)`) since it is the default
visual transformation for `frequency`.

Now, an example with `density`:

```language-julia
plt = data(df) *
    mapping(:grade) *
    density()
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_density.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 56: AlgebraOfGraphics bar plot with density estimation.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_density>

Analogous to the previous examples, `density` does not need a visual
transformation layer. Additionally, we only need to pass a single
continuous variable as the only positional argument inside `mapping`.
`density` will compute the distribution density of this variable which
we can fuse all the layers together and visualize the plot with `draw`.

For the last two statistical transformations, `linear` and `smooth`,
they cannot be used with the `*` operator. This is because `*` fuses two
or more layers into a #emph[single] layer. `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` cannot
represent these transformations with a #emph[single] layer. Hence, we
need to #strong[superimpose layers with the `+` operator];. First, let’s
generate some data:

```language-julia
x = rand(1:5, 100)
y = x + rand(100) .* 2
synthetic_df = DataFrame(; x, y)
first(synthetic_df, 5)
```

#figure(
  align(center)[#table(
    columns: 2,
    align: (right,right,),
    table.header([x], [y],),
    table.hline(),
    [2.0], [3.157977830566549],
    [3.0], [3.7778136901499835],
    [5.0], [5.791188059096232],
    [1.0], [2.520221175243375],
    [2.0], [3.4234278860680734],
  )]
  , kind: table
  )

Let’s begin with `linear`:

```language-julia
plt = data(synthetic_df) *
    mapping(:x, :y) *
    (visual(Scatter) + linear())
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_linear.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 57: AlgebraOfGraphics scatter plot with linear trend
    estimation.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_linear>

We are using the #strong[distribute property]
(Section~#link(<sec:aog>)[7];) for more efficient code inside our
`mapping`, `a  * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a + b)`, where:

- `a`: the `data` and `mapping` layers fused into a single layer
- `b`: the `visual` transformation layer
- `c`: the statistical `linear` transformation layer

`linear` adds a linear trend between the X- and Y-axis mappings with a
95% confidence interval shaded region.

Finally, the same example as before but now replacing `linear` with
`smooth`:

```language-julia
plt = data(synthetic_df) *
    mapping(:x, :y) *
    (visual(Scatter) + smooth())
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_smooth.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 58: AlgebraOfGraphics scatter plot with smooth trend
    estimation.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_smooth>

`smooth` adds a smooth trend between the X- and Y-axis mappings.

== Plot Customizations
<sec:aog_custom>
Apart from mappings inside a `mapping` layer, you can #strong[customize
`AlgebraOfGraphics` visualizations inside the `visual` transformation
layers];.

For example the `linear` statistical transformation plot from
Section~#link(<sec:aog_stats>)[7.3] can be customized both with the
marker objects in the scatter plot but also with the line object in the
linear trend plot. We can customize anything that the `Makie.jl`’s
plotting types support inside `visual`:

```language-julia
blue = visual(Scatter; color=:steelblue, marker=:cross)
red = linear() * visual(; color=:red, linestyle=:dot, linewidth=5)
plt = data(synthetic_df) * mapping(:x, :y) * (blue + red)
draw(plt)
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_custom_visual.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 59: AlgebraOfGraphics customized scatter plot with linear
    trend estimation.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_custom_visual>

As you can see we are adding the following keyword arguments to
`visual(Scatter)` transformation layer:

- `color`: a `Symbol` for a light blue color, `:steelblue`
- `marker`: a `Symbol` for a vertical cross marker type, `:cross`

Inside the `linear` statistical transformation we are adding a new layer
to be fused into it with the `*` operation, that does not have a
positional argument for plotting type since `linear` already provides a
default plotting type, and has the following keyword arguments:

- `color`: a `Symbol` for the red color, `:red`
- `linestyle`: a `Symbol` for a dotted line style, `:dot`
- `linewidth`: a number representing the width of our line

You can use as many customizations as you want in your plot.

== Makie.jl and AlgebraOfGraphics.jl
<sec:aog_makie>
Since `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` uses #strong[`Makie.jl` as a backend];,
most of #strong[advanced customizations] such as layouts are only
possible by interacting directly with `Makie.jl`. `Makie.jl` layouts
uses `Figure`, `Axis` and other types (see
Section~#link(<sec:makie_layouts>)[6.8];).

You can instantiate a `Figure` and use the #emph[mutating] `draw!`
function to draw a layer into an existing `Figure` or `Axis`. It is
preferable to pass a `GridPosition`, e.g.~`fig[1, 1]`, instead of an
`Axis` because `draw!` can pass `Axis` attributes, such as axis labels
and axis tick labels, to the underlying visualization. If you pass an
`Axis` to `draw!` these attributes need to be specified again as keyword
arguments inside `Axis`:

```julia
fig = Figure()

# preferable
draw!(fig[1, 1], plt)

# avoid
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1])
draw!(ax, plt)
```

As an example, let’s create an advanced layout by combining `Makie.jl`
with `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl`. We’ll use visualizations that had been
already covered in this chapter:

```language-julia
# Figure
fig = Figure()

# First Axis
plt_barplot = data(df) *
    mapping(
        :name,
        :grade;
        color=:year,
        dodge=:year) *
visual(BarPlot)
subfig1 = draw!(fig[1, 1], plt_barplot)

# Second Axis
plt_custom = data(synthetic_df) *
    mapping(:x, :y) *
    (
        visual(Scatter; color=:steelblue, marker=:cross)
        + (
            linear() * visual(; color=:red, linestyle=:dot, linewidth=5)
        )
    )
subfig2 = draw!(fig[2, 1:2], plt_custom)

# Third Axis
plt_expectation = data(df) *
    mapping(:name, :grade) *
    expectation()
subfig3 = draw!(fig[1, 2], plt_expectation)

# Insert the legend
legend!(
    fig[end+1, 1:2],
    subfig1;
    orientation=:horizontal,
    tellheight=true
)

# Recover the Figure
fig
```

#figure(image("_build/im/aog_makie.png", width: 60%),
  caption: [
    Figure 60: AlgebraOfGraphics custom layout with Makie.
  ]
)
<fig:aog_makie>

Here, we are instantiating a `Figure` called `fig`. Then, we proceed by
creating three `Layer`s that have the prefix `plt_`. Each one of these
are followed by a `draw!` with the desired `fig`’s `GridPosition` as the
first position argument followed by the `Layer` as the second argument.
Furthermore, we use `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl`’s `legend!` to add the legend
to the visualization. They way `legend!` works is by passing first the
desired `fig`’s `GridPosition` for the placement of the legend, and the
desired legend labels. For the legend’s label, we use the output of the
`draw!` function that was called in the `Layer`s and that has legend
labels already, in our case the `plt_barplot`. All of the
`Legend`/`axislegend` keyword arguments
(Section~#link(<sec:datavisMakie_attributes>)[6.2];) can be used in
`legend!`. Finally, as the last step, we call the Figure, `fig`, to
recover it after it was mutated by all of the mutating "bang" functions,
e.g.~`draw!` and `legend!`, in order to render our visualization.

== Notation
<sec:notation>
In this book, we try to keep notation as consistent as possible. This
makes reading and writing code easier. We can define the notation into
three parts.

=== Julia Style Guide
<julia-style-guide>
Firstly, we attempt to stick to the conventions from the
#link("https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/")[Julia Style Guide];.
Most importantly, we write functions not scripts (see also
Section~#link(<sec:engineering>)[1.2];). Furthermore, we use naming
conventions consistent with Julia `base/`, meaning:

- Use camelcase for modules: `module JuliaDataScience`,
  `struct MyPoint`. (Note that camel case is so called because the
  capitalization of words, as in "iPad" or "CamelCase", makes the word
  look like a camel).
- Write function names in lowercase letters and separate the words by
  underscores. It is also allowed to omit the separator when naming
  functions. For example, these function names are all in line with the
  conventions: `my_function`, `myfunction` and `string2int`.

Also, we avoid brackets in conditionals, that is, we write `if a == b`
instead of `if (a == b)` and use 4 spaces per indentation level.

=== BlueStyle
<bluestyle>
The #link("https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle")[Blue Style Guide] adds
multiple conventions on top of the default Julia Style Guide. Some of
these rules might sound pedantic, but we found that they make the code
more readable.

From the style guide, we attempt to adhere specifically to:

- At most 92 characters per line in code (in Markdown files, longer
  lines are allowed).

- When loading code via `using`, load at most one module per line.

- No trailing whitespace. Trailing whitespace makes inspecting changes
  in code more difficult since they do not change the behavior of the
  code but do show up as changes.

- Avoid extraneous spaces inside brackets. So, write `string(1, 2)`
  instead of `string( 1 , 2 )`.

- Global variables should be avoided.

- Try to limit function names to one or two words.

- Use the semicolon to clarify whether an argument is a keyword argument
  or not. For example, `func(x; y=3)` instead of `func(x, y=3)`.

- Avoid using multiple spaces to align things. So, write

  ```
  a = 1
  lorem = 2
  ```

  instead of

  ```
  a     = 1
  lorem = 2
  ```

- Whenever appropriate, surround binary operators with a space, for
  example, `1 == 2` or `y = x + 1`.

- Indent triple-quotes and triple-backticks:

  ```
  s = """
      my long text:
      [...]
      the end.
      """
  ```

- Do not omit zeros in floats (even though Julia allows it). Hence,
  write `1.0` instead of `1.` and write `0.1` instead of `.1`.

- Use `in` in for loops and not = or ∈ (even though Julia allows it).

=== Our additions
<our-additions>
- In text, we reference the function call `M.foo(3, 4)` as `M.foo` and
  not `M.foo(...)` or `M.foo()`.
- When talking about packages, like the DataFrames package, we
  explicitly write `DataFrames.jl` each time. This makes it easier to
  recognize that we are talking about a package.
- For filenames, we stick to "file.txt" and not `file.txt` or file.txt,
  because it is consistent with the code.
- For column names in tables, like the column `x`, we stick to column
  `:x`, because it is consistent with the code.
- Do not use Unicode symbols in inline code. This is simply a bug in the
  PDF generation that we have to workaround for now.
- The line before each code block ends with a colon (:) to indicate that
  the line belongs to the code block.

==== Loading of symbols
<loading-of-symbols>
Prefer to load symbols explicitly, that is, prefer `using A: foo` over
`using A` when not using the REPL @jump2021using. In this context, a
symbol means an identifier to an object. For example, even if it doesn’t
look like it normally, internally `DataFrame`, `π` and `CSV` are all
symbols. We notice this when we use an introspective method from Julia
such as `isdefined`:

```language-julia
isdefined(Main, :π)
```

```output

true
```

Next to being explicit when using `using`, also prefer `using A: foo`
over `import A: foo` because the latter makes it easy to accidentally
extend `foo`. Note that this isn’t just advice for Julia: implicit
loading of symbols via `from <module> import *` is also discouraged in
Python @pep8.

The reason why being explicit is important is related to semantic
versioning. With semantic versioning (#link("http://semver.org");), the
version number is related to whether a package is so-called
#emph[breaking] or not. For example, a non-breaking update for package
`A` is when the package goes from version `0.2.2` to `0.2.3`. With such
a non-breaking version update, you don’t need to worry that your package
will break, that is, throw an error or change behavior. If package `A`
goes from `0.2` to `1.0`, then that’s a breaking update and you can
expect that you need some changes in your package to make `A` work
again. #strong[However];, exporting extra symbols is considered a
non-breaking change. So, with implicit loading of symbols,
#strong[non-breaking changes can break your package];. That’s why it’s
good practice to explicitly load symbols.
