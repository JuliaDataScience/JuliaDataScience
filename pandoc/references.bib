We construct a model that explains how these strongly nonideal statistics can arise from environmental fluctuations, and also justifies our proposed strategy. We implement this strategy in the BenchmarkTools Julia package, where it is used in production continuous integration (CI) pipelines for developing the Julia language and its ecosystem.},

If you want to understand how to avoid bottlenecks and design your programs for the highest possible performance, then this book is for you.  The book starts with how Julia uses type information to achieve its performance goals, and how to use multiple dispatches to help the compiler emit high-performance machine code. After that, you will learn how to analyze Julia programs and identify issues with time and memory consumption. We teach you how to use Julia's typing facilities accurately to write high-performance code and describe how the Julia compiler uses type information to create fast machine code. Moving ahead, you'll master design constraints and learn how to use the power of the GPU in your Julia code and compile Julia code directly to the GPU. Then, you'll learn how tasks and asynchronous IO help you create responsive programs and how to use shared memory multithreading in Julia. Toward the end, you will get a flavor of Julia's distributed computing capabilities and how to run Julia programs on a large distributed cluster.  By the end of this book, you will have the ability to build large-scale, high-performance Julia applications, design systems with a focus on speed, and improve the performance of existing programs. What you will learn  Understand how Julia code is transformed into machine code  Measure the time and memory taken by Julia programs  Create fast machine code using Julia's type information  Define and call functions without compromising Julia's performance  Accelerate your code via the GPU  Use tasks and asynchronous IO for responsive programs  Run Julia programs on large distributed clusters Who this book is for This book is for beginners and intermediate Julia programmers who are interested in high-performance technical programming. A basic knowledge of Julia programming is assumed.Table of Contents  Julia is Fast Analyzing Performance Type, Type Inference, and Stability Making Fast Function Calls Fast Numbers Using Arrays Accelerating code with the GPU Concurrent programming with Tasks Threads Distributed Computing with Julia},

Computational modeling is how climate scientists reconcile our understanding of climate with what we observe. Traditionally, these models would have been written in Fortran, but today's climate emergency needs tools that are significantly easier to work with. Julia was built for this purpose and makes it easy for everybody focused on solving the problem to work together effectively. No more silos; we must now be part of an interconnected world.

This sharing of code comes in two forms: 1. Sharing basic types among a wide variety of packages providing disparate functionality; 2. Sharing generic algorithms that work on various implementations of common abstractions. Why does generic code in Julia "just work"? Why do Julia packages seem to share types with so little friction? Both kinds of reuse are supposed to be natural benefits of class-based object-oriented languages. After all, inheritance and encapsulation are two of the four pillars of OOP. Even more puzzling is that Julia has no encapsulation and doesn't allow inheriting from concrete types at all. Yet both kinds of code reuse are rampant. What is going on? In this talk, I make the case that both of kinds sharing stem directly from Julia's multiple dispatch programming paradigm.                   Show less                   Show more}
